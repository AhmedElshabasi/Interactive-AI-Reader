kForeword
by Nassim Nicholas Taleb
Let us follow the logic of things from the beginning. Or, rather,
from the end: modern times. We are, as I am writing these
lines, witnessing a complete riot against some class of experts, in
domains that are too difficult for us to understand, such as macroeco-nomic reality, and in which not only is the expert not an expert, buthe doesn’t know it. That previous Federal Reserve bosses Greenspanand Bernanke, had little grasp of empirical reality is something we onlydiscovered too late: one can macroBS longer than microBS, which is
why we need to be careful of whom to endow with centralized macro
decisions.
Whatmakesitworseisthatallcentralbanksoperatedunderthesame
model, making it a perfect monoculture.
In complex domains, expertise doesn’t concentrate: under organic
reality, things work in a distributed way, as F. A. Hayek has convincingly
demonstrated. But Hayek used the notion of distributed knowledge.
Well, it looks like we do not even need the “knowledge” part for thingsto work well. Nor do we need individual rationality. All we need isstructure.

It doesn’t mean all participants have a democratic share in decisions.
Onemotivatedparticipantcandisproportionatelymovetheneedle(whatI have studied as the asymmetry of the minority rule). But every partic-ipant has the option to be that player.
Somehow, under scale transformation, a miraculous effect emerges:
rational markets do not require any individual trader to be rational. Infact they work well under zero intelligence—a zero-intelligence crowd,under the right design, works better than a Soviet-style managementcomposed of maximally intelligent humans.
Which is why Bitcoin is an excellent idea. It fulfills the needs of
the complex system, not because it is a cryptocurrency, but preciselybecause it has no owner, no authority that can decide on its fate. It isowned by the crowd, its users. And it now has a track record of severalyears, enough for it to be an animal in its own right.
For other cryptocurrencies to compete, they need to have such a
Hayekian property.
Bitcoinisacurrencywithoutagovernment.But,onemayask,didn’t
wehavegold,silver,andothermetals,anotherclassofcurrencieswithoutagovernment?Notquite.Whenyoutradegold,youtrade“loco”HongKong and end up receiving a claim on a stock there, which you mightneed to move to New Jersey. Banks control the custodian game andgovernments control banks (or, rather, bankers and government officialsare, to be polite, tight together). So Bitcoin has a huge advantage overgold in transactions: clearance does not require a specific custodian. Nogovernment can control what code you have in your head.
Finally, Bitcoin will go through hiccups. It may fail; but then it will
be easily reinvented as we now know how it works. In its present state,it may not be convenient for transactions, not good enough to buy yourdecaffeinated espresso macchiato at your local virtue-signaling coffeechain. It may be too volatile to be a currency for now. But it is the
first organic currency.
But its mere existence is an insurance policy that will remind gov-
ernments that the last object the establishment could control, namely,the currency, is no longer their monopoly. This gives us, the crowd, aninsurance policy against an Orwellian future.

kPrologue
On November 1, 2008, a computer programmer going by the
pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto sent an email to a cryptogra-phy mailing list to announce that he had produced a “new
electronic cash system that’s fully peer-to-peer, with no trusted third
party.”
1He copied the abstract of the paper explaining the design, and
a link to it online. In essence, Bitcoin offered a payment network with
its own native currency, and used a sophisticated method for membersto verify all transactions without having to trust in any single member
of the network. The currency was issued at a predetermined rate to
reward the members who spent their processing power on verifying the
transactions, thus providing a reward for their work. The startling thing
about this invention was that, contrary to many other previous attempts
at setting up a digital cash, it actually worked.
While a clever and neat design, there wasn’t much to suggest that
such a quirky experiment would interest anyone outside the circles of
cryptography geeks. For months this was the case, as barely a few dozen
users worldwide were joining the network and engaging in mining and

sending each other coins that began to acquire the status of collectibles,
albeit in digital form.
But in October 2009, an Internet exchange2sold 5,050 bitcoins for
$5.02, at a price of $1 for 1,006 bitcoins, to register the first purchaseof a bitcoin with money.
3The price was calculated by measuring the
valueoftheelectricityneededtoproduceabitcoin.Ineconomicterms,
this seminal moment was arguably the most significant in Bitcoin’s life.
Bitcoin was no longer just a digital game being played within a fringe
community of programmers; it had now become a market good witha price, indicating that someone somewhere had developed a positive
valuation for it. On May 22, 2010, someone else paid 10,000 bitcoins
to buy two pizza pies worth $25, representing the first time that bitcoinwasusedasamediumofexchange.Thetokenhadneededsevenmonths
to transition from being a market good to being a medium of exchange.
Since then, the Bitcoin network has grown in the number of users
and transactions, and the processing power dedicated to it, while the
value of its currency has risen quickly, exceeding $7,000 per bitcoin asofNovember2017.

Bitcoin can be best understood as distributed software that allows
for transfer of value using a currency protected from unexpected infla-
tion without relying on trusted third parties. In other words, Bitcoinautomates the functions of a modern central bank and makes them pre-
dictableandvirtuallyimmutablebyprogrammingthemintocodedecen-

ception of these problems based on years of studying this technology
and the economic problems it solves, and how societies have previously
found solutions for them throughout history. My conclusion may sur-
prisethosewholabelBitcoinascamorruseofspeculatorsandpromoters

Historycanforeshadowwhat’stocome,particularlywhenexamined

it must, the first partof the book explainsmoney, its function and prop-
erties. As an economist with an engineering background, I have always
sought to understand a technology in terms of the problems it purports
to solve, which allows for the identification of its functional essence and
its separation from incidental, cosmetic, and insignificant characteristics.
By understanding the problems money attempts to solve, it becomes
possible to elucidate what makes for sound and unsound money, and
to apply that conceptual framework to understand how and why vari-
ousgoods,suchasseashells,beads,metals,andgovernmentmoney,have
served the function of money, and how and why they may have failed at
it or served society’s purposes to store value and exchange it.
The second part of the book discusses the individual, social, and
global implications of sound and unsound forms of money through-
out history. Sound money allows people to think about the long term
and to save and invest more for the future. Saving and investing for
the long run are the key to capital accumulation and the advance of
human civilization. Money is the information and measurement system
of an economy, and sound money is what allows trade, investment, and
entrepreneurship to proceed on a solid basis, whereas unsound money
throws these processes into disarray. Sound money is also an essential
element of a free society as it provides for an effective bulwark against
despotic government.
The third section of the book explains the operation of the Bitcoin
network and its most salient economic characteristics, and analyzes the
possible uses of Bitcoin as a form of sound money, discussing some useTrim Size: 6in x 9in Ammous f04.tex V1 - 03/05/2018 1:08pm Page xviii k

Money
Bitcoin is the newest technology to serve the function of
money—an invention leveraging the technological possibilities
of the digital age to solve a problem that has persisted for all
of humanity’s existence: how to move economic value across time andspace. In order to understand Bitcoin, one must first understand money,and to understand money, there is no alternative to the study of the
function and history of money.
The simplest way for people to exchange value is to exchange valu-
able goods with one another. This process of direct exchange is referred
to as barter, but is only practical in small circles with only a few goods
and services produced. In a hypothetical economy of a dozen peopleisolated from the world, there is not much scope for specialization andtrade, and it would be possible for individuals to each engage in the
production of the most basic essentials of survival and exchange them
among themselves directly. Barter has always existed in human societyandcontinuestothisday,butitishighlyimpracticalandremainsonlyin

familiarity with one another.
In a more sophisticated and larger economy, the opportunity arises
for individuals to specialize in the production of more goods and to
exchange them with many more people—people with whom they haveno personal relationships, strangers with whom it is utterly impracticalto keep a running tally of goods, services, and favors. The larger themarket, the more the opportunities for specialization and exchange, but
also the bigger the problem of coincidence of wants —what you want to
acquireisproducedbysomeonewhodoesn’twantwhatyouhavetosell.The problem is deeper than different requirements for different goods,as there are three distinct dimensions to the problem.
First, there is the lack of coincidence in scales: what you want may
not be equal in value to what you have and dividing one of them into
smaller units may not be practical. Imagine wanting to sell shoes for ahouse;youcannotbuythehouseinsmallpieceseachequivalentinvalueto a pair of shoes, nor does the homeowner want to own all the shoes
whose value is equivalent to that of the house. Second, there is the lack
of coincidence in time frames: what you want to sell may be perishablebutwhatyouwanttobuyismoredurableandvaluable,makingithardtoaccumulateenoughofyourperishablegoodtoexchangeforthedurablegood at one point in time. It is not easy to accumulate enough apples
to be exchanged for a car at once, because they will rot before the deal
can be completed. Third, there is the lack of coincidence of locations:you may want to sell a house in one place to buy a house in anotherlocation, and (most) houses aren’t transportable. These three problemsmakedirectexchangehighlyimpracticalandresultinpeopleneedingto

naturally emerge, if only because those who chance upon it will be far
more productive than those who do not: a single medium of exchange
(or at most a small number of media of exchange) emerges for everyone
totradetheirgoodsfor.Agoodthatassumestheroleofawidelyaccepted
medium of exchange is called money.
Being a medium of exchange is the quintessential function that
defines money—in other words, it is a good purchased not to be
consumed(aconsumptiongood),nortobeemployedintheproduction
of other goods (an investment, or capital good), but primarily for the
sake of being exchanged for other goods. While investment is also
meant to produce income to be exchanged for other goods, it is distinctfrommoneyinthreerespects:first,itoffersareturn,whichmoneydoes
not offer; second, it always involves a risk of failure, whereas money is
supposed to carry the least risk; third, investments are less liquid thanmoney, necessitating significant transaction costs every time they are to
be spent. This can help us understand why there will always be demand
for money, and why holding investments can never entirely replace
money. Human life is lived with uncertainty as a given, and humans
cannot know for sure when they will need what amount of money.
1
Itiscommonsense,andage-oldwisdominvirtuallyallhumancultures,
for individuals to want to store some portion of their wealth in the
form of money, because it is the most liquid holding possible, allowing
the holder to quickly liquidate if she needs to, and because it involves
less risk than any investment. The price for the convenience of holdingmoney comes in the form of the forgone consumption that could have
beenhadwithit,andintheformoftheforgonereturnsthatcouldhave
been made from investing it.
From examining such human choices in market situations, Carl
Menger, the father of the Austrian school of economics and founder
of marginal analysis in economics, came up with an understanding of
the key property that leads to a good being adopted freely as money on
the market, and that is salability—the ease with which a good can be
1See Ludwig von Mises’ HumanAction, p. 250, for a discussion of how uncertainty about the future is
the key driver of demand for holding money. With no uncertainty of the future, humans could knowall their incomes and expenditures ahead of time and plan them optimally so they never have to holdany cash. But as uncertainty is an inevitable part of life, people must continue to hold money so they
have the ability to spend without having to know the future.Trim Size: 6in x 9in Ammous c01.tex V1 - 03/05/2018 1:08pm Page 4 k

sold on the market whenever its holder desires, with the least loss in
its price.2
There is nothing in principle that stipulates what should or should
not be used as money. Any person choosing to purchase something notfor its own sake, but with the aim of exchanging it for something else,is making it de facto money, and as people vary, so do their opinions
on, and choices of, what constitutes money. Throughout human his-
tory, many things have served the function of money: gold and silver,most notably, but also copper, seashells, large stones, salt, cattle, govern-ment paper, precious stones, and even alcohol and cigarettes in certainconditions.People’schoicesaresubjective,andsothereisno“right”and“wrong”choiceofmoney.Thereare,however,consequencestochoices.
The relative salability of goods can be assessed in terms of how well
they address the three facets of the problem of the lack of coincidenceof wants mentioned earlier: their salability across scales, across space,
and across time. A good that is salable across scales can be conveniently
dividedintosmallerunitsorgroupedintolargerunits,thusallowingtheholder to sell it in whichever quantity he desires. Salability across spaceindicates an ease of transporting the good or carrying it along as a per-son travels, and this has led to good monetary media generally havinghigh value per unit of weight. Both of these characteristics are not veryhardtofulfillbyalargenumberofgoodsthatcouldpotentiallyservethefunction of money. It is the third element, salability across time, whichis the most crucial.
A good’s salability across time refers to its ability to hold value into
the future, allowing the holder to store wealth in it, which is the secondfunction of money: storeofvalue . For a good to be salable across time it
has to be immune to rot, corrosion, and other types of deterioration.It is safe to say anyone who thought he could store his wealth for thelongterminfish,apples,ororangeslearnedthelessonthehardway,andlikely had very little reason to worry about storing wealth for a while.Physical integrity through time, however, is a necessary but insufficientcondition for salability across time, as it is possible for a good to loseits value significantly even if its physical condition remains unchanged.

For the good to maintain its value, it is also necessary that the supply of
thegoodnotincreasetoodrasticallyduringtheperiodduringwhichtheholderownsit.Acommoncharacteristicofformsofmoneythroughouthistory is the presence of some mechanism to restrain the productionof new units of the good to maintain the value of the existing units.The relative difficulty of producing new monetary units determines the
hardness of money: money whose supply is hard to increase is known
ashard money ,w h i l eeasy money is money whose supply is amenable to
large increases.
We can understand money’s hardness through understanding two
distinct quantities related to the supply of a good: (1) the stock,w h i c h
is its existing supply, consisting of everything that has been produced inthepast,minuseverythingthathasbeenconsumedordestroyed;and(2)theflow,whichistheextraproductionthatwillbemadeinthenexttime
period. The ratio between the stock and flow is a reliable indicator of a
good’shardnessasmoney,andhowwellitissuitedtoplayingamonetary
role. A good that has a low ratio of stock-to-flow is one whose existingsupply can be increased drastically if people start using it as a store ofvalue. Such a good would be unlikely to maintain value if chosen as astore of value. The higher the ratio of the stock to the flow, the morelikely a good is to maintain its value over time and thus be more salableacross time.

If people choose a hard money, with a high stock-to-flow ratio, as a
store of value, their purchasing of it to store it would increase demand
forit,causingariseinitsprice,whichwouldincentivizeitsproducersto
make more of it. But because the flow is small compared to the existingsupply,evenalargeincreaseinthenewproductionisunlikelytodepressthe price significantly. On the other hand, if people chose to store theirwealth in an easy money, with a low stock-to-flow ratio, it would betrivial for the producers of this good to create very large quantities of itthat depress the price, devaluing the good, expropriating the wealth ofthe savers, and destroying the good’s salability across time.

The corollary to this trap is that anything that is successfully used asmoney will have some natural or artificial mechanism that restricts the
new flow of the good into the market, maintaining its value across time.
It therefore follows that for something to assume a monetary role, it hasto be costly to produce, otherwise the temptation to make money onthe cheap will destroythe wealthof the savers, and destroy the incentiveanyone has to save in this medium.
Whenever a natural, technological, or political development
resulted in quickly increasing the new supply of a monetary good, thegood would lose its monetary status and be replaced by other mediaof exchange with a more reliably high stock-to-flow ratio, as will bediscussed in the next chapter. Seashells were used as money when they
were hard to find, loose cigarettes are used as money in prisons because
they are hard to procure or produce, and with national currencies, thelower the rate of increase of the supply, the more likely the currency isto be held by individuals and maintain its value over time.
When modern technology made the importation and catching of
seashellseasy,societiesthatusedthemswitchedtometalorpapermoney,and when a government increases its currency’s supply, its citizens shiftto holding foreign currencies, gold, or other more reliable monetaryassets. The twentieth century provided us an unfortunately enormous

not something that is static in time. As the technological capabilities ofdifferent societies and eras have varied, so has the hardness of variousformsofmoney,andwithittheirsalability.Inreality,thechoiceofwhatmakes the best money has always been determined by the technologi-cal realities of societies shaping the salability of different goods.

easily matters the most. A medium of exchange, as mentioned before, isnot acquired for its own properties, but for its salability.
Further, wide acceptance of a medium of exchange allows all prices
to be expressed in its terms, which allows it to play the third function
of money:unit of account . In an economy with no recognized medium
of exchange, each good will have to be priced in terms of each othergood, leading to a large number of prices, making economic calcula-tions exceedingly difficult. In an economy with a medium of exchange,
allpricesofallgoodsareexpressedintermsofthesameunitofaccount.
In this society money serves as a metric with which to measure inter-personal value; it rewards producers to the extent that they contributevalue to others, and signifies to consumers how much they need to paytoobtaintheirdesiredgoods.Onlywithauniformmediumofexchange
acting as a unit of account does complex economic calculation become
possible, and with it comes the possibility for specialization into com-plex tasks, capital accumulation, and large markets. The operation of amarket economy is dependent on prices, and prices, to be accurate, aredependent on a common medium of exchange, which reflects the rel-
ative scarcity of different goods. If this is easy money, the ability of its
issuer to constantly increase its quantity will prevent it from accuratelyreflectingopportunitycosts.Everyunpredictablechangeinthequantityof money would distort its role as a measure of interpersonal value anda conduit for economic information.

the function of money for a period during which it had one of the best

OfallthehistoricalformsofmoneyIhavecomeacross,theone
that most resembles the operation of Bitcoin is the ancientsystem based on Rai stones on Yap Island, today a part of the
Federated States of Micronesia. Understanding how the large circularstones carved from limestone functioned as money will help us explainBitcoin’s operation in Chapter 8. Understanding the remarkable tale ofhow the Rai stones lost their monetary role is an object lesson in howmoney loses its monetary status once it loses its hardness.
The Rai stones that constituted money were of various sizes, ris-
ing to large circular disks with a hole in the middle that weighed up tofourmetrictons.TheywerenotnativetoYap,whichdidnotcontainanylimestone,andallofYap’sstoneswerebroughtinfromneighboringPalauorGuam.Thebeautyandrarityofthesestonesmadethemdesirableandvenerable in Yap, but procuring them was very difficult as it involved alaborious process of quarrying and then shipping them with rafts andcanoes. Some of these rocks required hundreds of people to transport
them, and once they arrived on Yap, they were placed in a prominent

location where everyone could see them. The owner of the stone could
use it as a payment method without it having to move: all that wouldhappenisthattheownerwouldannouncetoalltownsfolkthatthestone’sownershiphasnowmovedtotherecipient.Thewholetownwouldrec-ognize the ownership of the stone and the recipient could then use it tomake a payment whenever he so pleased.

by the difficulty and high cost of acquiring new stones, because they
didn’t exist in Yap and quarrying and shipping them from Palau was noteasy. The very high cost of procuring new stones to Yap meant that theexisting supply of stones was always far larger than whatever new sup-ply could be produced at a given period of time, making it prudent toacceptthemasaformofpayment.Inotherwords,Raistoneshadaveryhigh stock-to-flow ratio, and no matter how desirable they were, it wasnot easy for anyone to inflate the supply of stones by bringing in newrocks.Or,atleast,thatwasthecaseuntil1871,whenanIrish-Americancaptain by the name of David O’Keefe was shipwrecked on the shoresof Yap and revived by the locals.

to what O’Keefe expected, the villagers were not keen on receiving his
stones, and the village chief banned his townsfolk from working for thestones, decreeing that O’Keefe’s stones were not of value, because they
weregatheredtooeasily.Onlythestonesquarriedtraditionally,withthe
sweat and blood of the Yapese, were to be accepted in Yap. Others onthe island disagreed, and they did supply O’Keefe with the coconuts hesought. This resulted in conflict on the island, and in time the demiseof Rai stones as money. Today, the stones serve a more ceremonial and
cultural role on the island and modern government money is the most
commonly used monetary medium.
While O’Keefe’s story is highly symbolic, he was but the harbinger
oftheinevitabledemiseofRaistones’monetaryrolewiththeencroach-ment of modern industrial civilization on Yap and its inhabitants. As
modern tools and industrial capabilities reached the region, it was
inevitablethattheproductionofthestoneswouldbecomefarlesscostlythan before. There would be many O’Keefes, local and foreign, able tosupply Yap with an ever-larger flow of new stones. With modern tech-
nology, the stock-to-flow ratio for Rai stones decreased drastically: it
was possible to produce far more of these stones every year, significantlydevaluing the island’s existing stock. It became increasingly unwise foranyonetousethesestonesasastoreofvalue,andthustheylosttheirsal-ability across time, and with it, their function as a medium of exchange.
The details may differ, but the underlying dynamic of a drop in
stock-to-flow ratio has been the same for every form of money thathas lost its monetary role, up to the collapse of the Venezuelan bolivartaking place as these lines are being written.
A similar story happened with the aggry beads used as money for
centuries in western Africa. The history of these beads in western
Africa is not entirely clear, with suggestions that they were made frommeteorite stones, or passed on from Egyptian and Phoenician traders.What is known is that they were precious in an area where glassmakingtechnology was expensive and not very common, giving them a high
stock-to-flow ratio, making them salable across time. Being small and
valuable, these beads were salable across scale, because they could becombined into chains, necklaces, or bracelets; though this was far fromideal, because there were many different kinds of beads rather than onestandard unit. They were also salable across space as they were easyTrim Size: 6in x 9in Ammous c02.tex V1 - 03/05/2018 1:08pm Page 14 k

to move around. In contrast, glass beads were not expensive and had
no monetary role in Europe, because the proliferation of glassmakingtechnology meant that if they were to be utilized as a monetary unit,
their producers could flood the market with them—in other words,
they had a low stock-to-flow ratio.
WhenEuropeanexplorersandtradersvisitedWestAfricainthesix-
teenth century, they noticed the high value given to these beads and sostarted importing them in mass quantities from Europe. What followed
was similar to the story of O’Keefe, but given the tiny size of the beads
and the much larger size of the population, it was a slower, more covertprocess with bigger and more tragic consequences. Slowly but surely,EuropeanswereabletopurchasealotofthepreciousresourcesofAfrica
for the beads they acquired back home for very little.

sion into Africa slowly turned beads from hard money to easy money,destroying their salability and causing the erosion of the purchasingpower of these beads over time in the hands of the Africans who ownedthem,impoverishingthembytransferringtheirwealthtotheEuropeans,
who could acquire the beads easily. The aggry beads later came to be
known as slave beads for the role they played in fueling the slave tradeof Africans to Europeans and North Americans. A one-time collapse inthe value of a monetary medium is tragic, but at least it is over quicklyand its holders can begin trading, saving, and calculating with a new

Seashells are another monetary medium that was widely used in
many places around the world, from North America to Africa and Asia.
Historical accounts show that the most salable seashells were usuallythe ones that were scarcer and harder to find, because these would holdvalue more than the ones that can be found easily.

same reasons as aggry beads: they were hard to find, giving them a high
stock-to-flow ratio, possibly the highest among durable goods available
at the time. Seashells also shared with aggry beads the disadvantage of
not being uniform units, which meant prices and ratios could not beeasily measured and expressed in them uniformly, which creates large
obstaclestothegrowthoftheeconomyandthedegreeofspecialization.
European settlers adopted seashells as legal tender from 1636, but asmore and more British gold and silver coins started flowing to North
America, these were preferred as a medium of exchange due to their
uniformity, allowing for better and more uniform price denominationand giving them higher salability. Further, as more advanced boats andtechnologies were employed to harvest seashells from the sea, their
supply was very highly inflated, leading to a drop in their value and
a loss of salability across time. By 1661, seashells stopped being legaltender and eventually lost all monetary role.

This was not just the fate of seashell money in North America;
whenever societies employing seashells had access to uniform metalcoins,theyadoptedthemandbenefitedfromtheswitch.Also,thearrival
of industrial civilization, with fossil-fuel-powered boats, made scouring
the sea for seashells easier, increasing the flow of their production anddropping the stock-to-flow ratio quickly.

As technology advanced, particularly with metallurgy, humans
developed superior forms of money to these artifacts, which began
to quickly replace them. These metals proved a better medium of
exchangethanseashells,stones,beads,cattle,andsaltbecausetheycouldbe made into uniform, highly valuable small units that could be movedaround far more easily. Another nail in the coffin of artifact money
came with the mass utilization of hydrocarbon fuel energy, which
increased our productive capacity significantly, allowing for a quickincrease in the new supply (flow) of these artifacts, meaning that theforms of money that relied on difficulty of production to protect their
high stock-to-flow ratio lost it. With modern hydrocarbon fuels, Rai
stonescouldbequarriedeasily,aggrybeadscouldbemadeforverylittlecost, and seashells could be collected en masse by large boats. As soonas these monies lost their hardness, their holders suffered significant
wealth expropriation and the entire fabric of their society fell apart as
a result. The Yap Island chiefs who refused O’Keefe’s cheap Rai stonesunderstood what most modern economists fail to grasp: a money thatis easy to produce is no money at all, and easy money does not make
a society richer; on the contrary, it makes it poorer by placing all its
hard-earned wealth for sale in exchange for something easy to produce.Trim Size: 6in x 9in Ammous c03.tex V1 - 03/05/2018 1:08pm Page 17 k

Gold coins were the goods most salable across time, becausethey could hold their value over time and resist decay and ruin.

Bythenineteenthcentury,however,withthedevelopmentofmod-
ern banking and the improvement in methods of communication, indi-
viduals could transact with paper money and checks backed by gold inthe treasuries of their banks and central banks. This made gold-backed
transactionspossibleatanyscale,thusobviatingtheneedforsilver’smon-
etary role, and gathering all essential monetary salability properties in
the gold standard. The gold standard allowed for unprecedented global
capital accumulation and trade by uniting the majority of the planet’s
economy on one sound market-based choice of money. Its tragic flaw,
however,wasthatbycentralizingthegoldinthevaultsofbanks,andlater
central banks, it made it possible for banks and governments to increase
the supply of money beyond the quantity of gold they held, devaluing
the money and transferring part of its value from the money’s legitimate
holders to the governments and banks.
Why Gold?
To understand how commodity money emerges, we return in more
detail to the easy money trap we first introduced in Chapter 1, and
begin by differentiating between a good’s market demand (demand for
consumingorholdingthegoodforitsownsake)andits monetary demand
(demand for a good as a medium of exchange and store of value). Any
timeapersonchoosesagoodasastoreofvalue,sheiseffectivelyincreas-
ing the demand for it beyond the regular market demand, which will
cause its price to rise. For example, market demand for copper in its
various industrial uses is around 20 million tons per year, at a price of
around $5,000 per ton, and a total market valued around $100 billion.
Imagine a billionaire deciding he would like to store $10 billion of his
wealthincopper.Ashisbankersrunaroundtryingtobuy10%ofannual
globalcopperproduction,theywouldinevitablycausethepriceofcop-
per to increase. Initially, this sounds like a vindication of the billionaire’s
monetary strategy: the asset he decided to buy has already appreciated
beforehehasevencompletedhispurchase.Surely,hereasons,thisappre-
ciation will cause more people to buy more copper as a store of value,
bringing the price up even more.Trim Size: 6in x 9in Ammous c03.tex V1 - 03/05/2018 1:08pm Page 20 k

But even if more people join him in monetizing copper, our hypo-
thetical copper-obsessed billionaire is in trouble. The rising price makes
copperalucrativebusinessforworkersandcapitalacrosstheworld.The
quantity of copper under the earth is beyond our ability to even mea-
sure, let alone extract through mining, so practically speaking, the only
binding restraint on how much copper can be produced is how much
laborandcapitalisdedicatedtothejob.Morecoppercanalwaysbemade
withahigherprice,andthepriceandquantitywillcontinuetoriseuntil
they satisfy the monetary investors’ demand; let’s assume that happens at
10 million extra tons and $10,000 per ton. At some point, monetary
demand must subside, and some holders of copper will want to offload
some of their stockpiles to purchase other goods, because, after all, that
was the point of buying copper.
After the monetary demand subsides, all else being equal, the cop-
permarketwouldgobacktoitsoriginalsupply-and-demandconditions,
with 20 million annual tons selling for $5,000 each. But as the holders
begin to sell their accumulated stocks of copper, the price will drop sig-
nificantlybelowthat.Thebillionairewillhavelostmoneyinthisprocess;
ashewasdrivingthepriceup,heboughtmostofhisstockformorethan

others who joined him later bought at even higher prices and will have
lost even more money than the billionaire himself.
This model is applicable for all consumable commodities such as
copper, zinc, nickel, brass, or oil, which are primarily consumed and
destroyed, not stockpiled. Global stockpiles of these commodities at any
moment in time are around the same order of magnitude as new annual
production. New supply is constantly being generated to be consumed.
Should savers decide to store their wealth in one of these commodities,
their wealth will only buy a fraction of global supply before bidding the
price up enough to absorb all their investment, because they are com-
peting with the consumers of this commodity who use it productively
in industry. As the revenue to the producers of the good increases, they
can then invest in increasing their production, bringing the price crash-
ingdownagain,robbingthesaversoftheirwealth.Theneteffectofthis
entire episode is the transfer of the wealth of the misguided savers to the
producers of the commodity they purchased.Trim Size: 6in x 9in Ammous c03.tex V1 - 03/05/2018 1:08pm Page 21 k

This is the anatomy of a market bubble: increased demand causes a
sharp rise in prices, which drives further demand, raising prices fur-ther, incentivizing increased production and increased supply, which
inevitablybringspricesdown,punishingeveryonewhoboughtataprice
higher than the usual market price. Investors in the bubble are fleecedwhile producers of the asset benefit. For copper and almost every othercommodityintheworld,thisdynamichasheldtrueformostofrecordedhistory, consistently punishing those who choose these commodities as
money by devaluing their wealth and impoverishing them in the long
run, and returning the commodity to its natural role as a market good,and not a medium of exchange.
For anything to function as a good store of value, it has to beat this
trap:ithastoappreciatewhenpeopledemanditasastoreofvalue,butits
producers have to be constrained from inflating the supply significantly
enough to bring the price down. Such an asset will reward those whochoose it as their store of value, increasing their wealth in the long runas it becomes the prime store of value, because those who chose other
commodities will either reverse course by copying the choice of their
more successful peers, or will simply lose their wealth.
The clear winner in this race throughout human history has been
gold, which maintains its monetary role due to two unique physicalcharacteristics that differentiate it from other commodities: first, gold
is so chemically stable that it is virtually impossible to destroy, and sec-
ond, gold is impossible to synthesize from other materials (alchemists’claims notwithstanding) and can only be extracted from its unrefinedore, which is extremely rare in our planet.
The chemical stability of gold implies that virtually all of the gold
ever mined by humans is still more or less owned by people around the

With silver no longer requiredfor smaller transactions, it soon lost its monetary role and became anindustrial metal, losing value compared to gold. Silver may maintain itssporting connotation for second place, but as nineteenth-century tech-nology made payments possible without having to move the monetaryunit itself, second place in monetary competition was equivalent tolosing out.
This explains why the silver bubble has popped before and will pop
again if it ever inflates: as soon as significant monetary investment flowsinto silver, it is not as difficult for producers to increase the supply sig-nificantly and bring the price crashing down, taking the savers’ wealthin the process. The best-known example of the easy-money trap comesfrom silver itself, of all commodities. Back in the late 1970s, the veryaffluentHuntbrothersdecidedtobringabouttheremonetizationofsil-ver and started buying enormous quantities of silver, driving the priceup. Their rationale was that as the price rose, more people would wantto buy, which would keep the price rising, which in turn would lead topeople wanting to be paid in silver. Yet, no matter how much the Huntbrothersbought,theirwealthwasnomatchfortheabilityofminersandholdersofsilvertokeepsellingsilverontothemarket.Thepriceofsilvereventually crashed and the Hunt brothers lost over $1bn, probably the
highest price ever paid for learning the importance of the stock-to-flow

As the production of metals began to proliferate, ancient civiliza-
tions in China, India, and Egypt began to use copper, and later silver, asmoney, as these two were relatively hard to manufacture at the time and
allowedforgoodsalabilityacrosstimeandspace.Goldwashighlyprized
inthesecivilizations,butitsraritymeantitssalabilityfortransactionswaslimited. It was in Greece, the birthplace of modern civilization, wheregold was first minted into regular coins for trade, under King Croe-sus. This invigorated global trade as gold’s global appeal saw the coinspread far and wide. Since then, the turns of human history have beenclosely intertwined with the soundness of money. Human civilization
flourished in times and places where sound money was widely adopted,
while unsound money all too frequently coincided with civilizationaldecline and societal collapse.
Roman Golden Age and Decline
The denarius was the silver coin that traded at the time of the RomanRepublic, containing 3.9 grams of silver, while gold became the mostvaluable money in the civilized areas of the world at the time and goldcoins were becoming more widespread. Julius Caesar, the last dictatorof the Roman Republic, created the aureus coin, which containedaround 8 grams of gold and was widely accepted across Europe andthe Mediterranean, increasing the scope of trade and specialization in
the Old World. Economic stability reigned for 75 years, even through
the political upheaval of his assassination, which saw the Republictransformed into an Empire under his chosen successor, Augustus. Thiscontinued until the reign of the infamous emperor Nero, who was thefirst to engage in the Roman habit of “coin clipping,” wherein theEmperor would collect the coins of the population and mint them into
newer coins with less gold or silver content.
For as long as Rome could conquer new lands with significant
wealth, its soldiers and emperors could enjoy spending their loot,and emperors even decided to buy themselves popularity by man-dating artificially low prices of grains and other staples, sometimeseven granting them for free. Instead of working for a living in the
countryside, many peasants would leave their farms to move to Rome,Trim Size: 6in x 9in Ammous c03.tex V1 - 03/05/2018 1:08pm Page 26 k

where they could live better lives for free. With time, the Old World
no longer had prosperous lands to be conquered, the ever-increasing
lavish lifestyle and growing military required some new source of
financing, and the number of unproductive citizens living off theemperor’s largesse and price controls increased. Nero, who ruled from
54–68 AD, had found the formula to solve this, which was highly
similar to Keynes’s solution to Britain’s and the U.S.’s problems after
World War I: devaluing the currency would at once reduce the real
wages of workers, reduce the burden of the government in subsidizingstaples, and provide increased money for financing other government
expenditure.
The aureus coin was reduced from 8 to 7.2 grams, while the
denarius’s silver content was reduced from 3.9 to 3.41g. This provided
some temporary relief, but had set in motion the highly destructive
self-reinforcing cycle of popular anger, price controls, coin debasement,
and price rises, following one another with the predictable regularity of
the four seasons.
5
Under the reign of Caracalla (AD 211–217), the gold content was
furtherreducedto6.5grams,andunderDiocletian(AD284–305)itwas
further reduced to 5.5g, before he introduced a replacement coin calledthe solidus, with only 4.5 grams of gold. On Diocletian’s watch, the
denarius only had traces of silver to cover its bronze core, and the silver
woulddisappearquitequicklywithwearandtear,endingthedenariusas

withitcamethemisguidedattemptsoftheemperorstohidetheirinfla-tion by placing price controls on basic goods. As market forces sought
to adjust prices upward in response to the debasement of the currency,
price ceilings prevented these price adjustments, making it unprofitablefor producers to engage in production. Economic production would
come to a standstill until a new edict allowed for the liberalization of
prices upward.
With this fall in the value of its money, the long process of terminal
decline of the empire resulted in a cycle that might appear familiar tomodernreaders:coinclippingreducedtheaureus’srealvalue,increasing

the money supply, allowing the emperor to continue imprudent
overspending, but eventually resulting in inflation and economic crises,
which the misguided emperors would attempt to ameliorate via further
coin clipping. Ferdinand Lips summarizes this process with a lesson to
modern readers:
It should be of interest to modern Keynesian economists, as well as
to the present generation of investors, that although the emperors ofRome frantically tried to “manage” their economies, they only suc-
ceeded in making matters worse. Price and wage controls and legal
tender laws were passed, but it was like trying to hold back the tides.Rioting, corruption, lawlessness and a mindless mania for specula-tion and gambling engulfed the empire like a plague. With money sounreliable and debased, speculation in commodities became far moreattractive than producing them.
6
The long-term consequences for the Roman Empire were devas-
tating. Although Rome up until the second century AD may not becharacterized as a full-fledged free market capitalist economy, because
it still had plenty of government restraints on economic activity, with
the aureus it nonetheless established what was then the largest market in
humanhistorywiththelargestandmostproductivedivisionoflaborthe
world had ever known.
7CitizensofRomeandthemajorcitiesobtained
their basic necessities by trade with the far-flung corners of the empire,
and this helps explain the growth in prosperity, and the devastating col-
lapse the empire suffered when this division of labor fell apart. As taxesincreased and inflation made price controls unworkable, the urbanites
of the cities started fleeing to empty plots of land where they could
at least have a chance of living in self-sufficiency, where their lack of
incomesparedthemhavingtopaytaxes.Theintricatecivilizationaledi-
fice of the Roman Empire and the large division of labor across Europeand the Mediterranean began to crumble, and its descendants became
self-sufficient peasants scattered in isolation and would soon turn into
serfs living under feudal lords.

Byzantium and the Bezant
The emperor Diocletian has forever had his name associated with fiscal
and monetary chicanery, and the Empire reached a nadir under his rule.
A year after he abdicated, however, Constantine the Great took overthe reins of the empire and reversed its fortunes by adopting econom-
ically responsible polices and reforms. Constantine, who was the first
Christian emperor, committed to maintaining the solidus at 4.5 gramsof gold without clipping or debasement and started minting it in large
quantities in 312 AD. He moved east and established Constantinople
at the meeting point of Asia and Europe, birthing the Eastern RomanEmpire, which took the solidus as its coin. While Rome continued its
economic, social, and cultural deterioration, finally collapsing in 476
AD, Byzantium survived for 1,123 years while the solidus became the
longest-serving sound currency in human history.
ThelegacyofConstantineinmaintainingtheintegrityofthesolidus
made it the world’s most recognizable and widely accepted currency,
and it came to be known as the bezant. While Rome burned under
bankrupt emperors who could no longer afford to pay their soldiers astheir currencies collapsed, Constantinople thrived and prospered for
many more centuries with fiscal and monetary responsibility. While
the Vandals and the Visigoths ran rampage in Rome, Constantinopleremained prosperous and free from invasion for centuries. As with
Rome, the fall of Constantinople happened only after its rulers had
started devaluing the currency, a process that historians believe beganin the reign of Constantine IX Monomachos (1042–1055).
8Along
with monetary decline came the fiscal, military, cultural, and spiritual
decline of the Empire, as it trudged on with increasing crises until itwas overtaken by the Ottomans in 1453.
Even after it was debased and its empire fell, the bezant lived on
by inspiring another form of sound money that continues to circulatewidelytothisdayinspiteofnotbeingtheofficialcurrencyofanynation
anymore, and that is the Islamic dinar. As Islam rose during the golden
age of Byzantium, the bezant and coins similar to it in weight and size

The Renaissance
AftertheeconomicandmilitarycollapseoftheRomanEmpire,feudal-ism emerged as the prime mode of organizing society. The destructionofsoundmoneywaspivotalinturningtheformercitizensoftheRomanEmpire into serfs under the mercy of their local feudal lords. Gold wasconcentrated in the hands of the feudal lords, and the main forms ofmoney available for the peasantry of Europe at the time were copper
and bronze coins, whose supply was easy to inflate as industrial produc-
tion of these metals continued to become easier with the advance ofmetallurgy, making them terrible stores of value, as well as silver coinsthat were usually debased, cheated, and nonstandardized across the con-tinent, giving them poor salability across space and limiting the scope oftrade across the continent.

While it is widely recognized that the rise of the city-states dragged
Europe out of the Dark Ages and into the Renaissance, the role ofsound money in this rise is less recognized. It was in the city-states
that humans could live with the freedom to work, produce, trade, and
flourish, and that was to a large extent the result of these city-statesadopting a sound monetary standard. It all began in Florence in 1252,whenthecitymintedtheflorin,thefirstmajorEuropeansoundcoinagesince Julius Caesar’s aureus. Florence’s rise made it the commercial cen-
ter of Europe, with its florin becoming the prime European medium
of exchange, allowing its banks to flourish across the entire continent.Venice was the first to follow Florence’s example with its minting ofthe ducat, of the same specifications as the florin ,in 1270, and by the
end of the fourteenth century more than 150 European cities and states
had minted coins of the same specifications as the florin, allowing their
citizens the dignity and freedom to accumulate wealth and trade with asound money that was highly salable across time and space, and dividedintosmallcoins,allowingforeasydivisibility.Withtheeconomiclibera-

precipice of barbarism and destruction.
Although the period following the introduction of the florin wit-
nessedanimprovementinthesoundnessofmoney,withmoreandmoreEuropeans able to adopt gold and silver for saving and trade, and theextent of markets expanding across Europe and the world, the situa-

currencies relative to one another were continuously self-defeating, but
gold’s monetary edge was to win out.
As sovereigns set an exchange rate between the two commodities,
they would change holders’ incentives to hold or spend them. This
inconvenient bimetallism continued for centuries across Europe and theworld, but as with the move from salt, cattle, and seashells to metals,the inexorable advance of technology was to provide a solution to it.
TwoparticulartechnologicaladvancementswouldmoveEuropeand
the world away from physical coins and in turn help bring about the
demise of silver’s monetary role: the telegraph, first deployed commer-cially in 1837, and the growing network of trains, allowing transporta-tion across Europe. With these two innovations, it became increasinglyfeasible for banks to communicate with each other, sending payments
efficiently across space when needed and debiting accounts instead of
having to send physical payments. This led to the increased use of bills,checks, and paper receipts as monetary media instead of physical goldand silver coins.
More nations began to switch to a monetary standard of paper fully
backed by, and instantly redeemable into, precious metals held in vaults.Some nations would choose gold, and others would choose silver, in afateful decision that was to have enormous consequences. Britain wasthe first to adopt a modern gold standard in 1717, under the direc-
tion of physicist Isaac Newton, who was the warden of the Royal Mint,
and the gold standard would play a great role in it advancing its tradeacross its empire worldwide. Britain would remain under a gold stan-dard until 1914, although it would suspend it during the Napoleonicwars from 1797 to 1821. The economic supremacy of Britain was intri-
cately linked to its being on a superior monetary standard, and other
Europeancountriesbegantofollowit.TheendoftheNapoleonicwarsheralded the beginning of the golden age of Europe, as, one by one, themajor European nations began adopting the gold standard. The morenations officially adopted the gold standard, the more marketable gold
became and the larger the incentive became for other nations to join.
Further, instead of individuals having to carry gold and silver coins
for large and small transactions, respectively, they could now store theirwealth in gold in banks while using paper receipts, bills, and checks tomake payments of any size. The holders of paper receipts could just useTrim Size: 6in x 9in Ammous c03.tex V1 - 03/05/2018 1:08pm Page 32 k

With these media being backed by physical gold in the vaults and
allowing payment in whichever quantity or size, there was no longer a
real need for silver’s role in small payments. The death knell for silver’smonetary role was the end of the Franco-Prussian war, when Germanyextracted an indemnity of £200 million in gold from France and usedit to switch to a gold standard. With Germany now joining Britain,France, Holland, Switzerland, Belgium, and others on a gold standard,the monetary pendulum had swung decisively in favor of gold, leadingto individuals and nations worldwide who used silver to witness a pro-gressive loss of their purchasing power and a stronger incentive to shift
to gold. India finally switched from silver to gold in 1898, while China
and Hong Kong were the last economies in the world to abandon thesilver standard in 1935.
For as long as gold and silver were used for payment directly, they
both had a monetary role to play and their price relative to one anotherremained largely constant across time, at a ratio between 12 and 15ounces of silver per ounce of gold, in the same range as their relativescarcity in the crust of the earth and the relative difficulty and cost ofextracting them. But as paper and financial instruments backed by these
metals became more and more popular, there was no more justification
for silver’s monetary role, and individuals and nations shifted to holdinggold,leadingtoasignificantcollapseinthepriceofsilver,fromwhichitwould not recover. The average ratio between the two over the twenti-eth century was 47:1, and in 2017, it stood at 75:1. While gold still hasa monetary role to play, as evidenced by central banks’ hoarding of it,silver has arguably lost its monetary role. (See Figure 3.

foreigners, and was being driven out by foreign hard money, which
allowed foreigners to control and own increasing quantities of thecapital and resources of China and India during the period. This is ahistorical lesson of immense significance, and should be kept in mind

deal with it. History shows it is not possible to insulate yourself from
the consequences of others holding money that is harder than yours.
With gold in the hands of increasingly centralized banks, it gained
salability across time, scales, and location, but lost its property as cash
money, making payments in it subject to the agreement of the financial
and political authorities issuing receipts, clearing checks, and hoard-
ing the gold. Tragically, the only way gold was able to solve the prob-
lems of salability across scales, space, and time was by being centralized
and thus falling prey to the major problem of sound money empha-
sized by the economists of the twentieth century: individual sovereignty
over money and its resistance to government centralized control. We
can thus understand why nineteenth-century sound money economists
like Menger focused their understanding of money’s soundness on its
salability as a market good, whereas twentieth-century sound money
economists, like Mises, Hayek, Rothbard, and Salerno, focused their
analysis of money’s soundness on its resistance to control by a sovereign.

of exchange. Some of the most important technological, medical, eco-
nomic, and artistic human achievements were invented during the era
of the gold standard, which partly explains why it was known as la belle
époque, or the beautiful era, across Europe. Britain witnessed the peak
years of Pax Britannica, where the British Empire expanded worldwide
and was not engaged in large military conflicts. In 1899, when Amer-

episode of monetary insanity, which was effectively the last dying pang
of silver as money, discussed in Chapter 6, when the Treasury tried to
remonetize silver by mandating it as money. This caused a large increase
in the money supply and a bank run by those seeking to sell Treasury

U.S. economic growth resumed.
With the majority of the world on one sound monetary unit, there
was never a period that witnessed as much capital accumulation, global
trade, restraint on government, and transformation of living standards
worldwide. Not only were the economies of the west far freer back
then, the societies themselves were far freer. Governments had very few
bureaucracies focused on micromanaging the lives of citizens. As Mises
described it:
The gold standard was the world standard of the age of capital-
ism, increasing welfare, liberty, and democracy, both political andeconomic. In the eyes of the free traders its main eminence wasprecisely the fact that it was an international standard as required byinternational trade and the transactions of the international moneyand capital markets. It was the medium of exchange by means ofwhich Western industrialism and Western capital had borne Westerncivilization to the remotest parts of the earth’s surface, everywheredestroying the fetters of old-aged prejudices and superstitions, sowing

and creating riches unheard of before. It accompanied the triumphal
unprecedented progress of Western liberalism ready to unite all

Thisworldcamecrashingdowninthecatastrophicyear1914,which
was not only the year of the outbreak of World War I, but the year that
theworld’smajoreconomieswentoffofthegoldstandardandreplacedit
with unsound government money. Only Switzerland and Sweden, whoremained neutral during World War I, were to remain on a gold stan-
dard into the 1930s. The era of government-controlled money was to
commencegloballyafterthat,withunmitigateddisastrousconsequences.
While the gold standard of the nineteenth century was arguably the
closest thing that the world had ever seen to an ideal sound money, itnonetheless had its flaws. First, governments and banks were always cre-
ating media of exchange beyond the quantity of gold in their reserves.
Second, many countries used not just gold in their reserves, but alsocurrencies of other countries. Britain, as the global superpower at that
time, had benefited from having its money used as a reserve currency
all around the world, resulting in its reserves of gold being a tiny frac-tion of its outstanding money supply. With growing international trade
relying on settlement of large quantities of money across the world, the
Bank of England’s banknotes became, in the minds of many at the time,
“as good as gold.” While gold was very hard money, the instruments
used for settlements of payments between central banks, although nom-inally redeemable in gold, ended up in practice being easier to produce
than gold.
These two flaws meant that the gold standard was always vulnera-
ble to a run on gold in any country where circumstances might lead
a large enough percentage of the population to demand redemption
of their paper money in gold. The fatal flaw of the gold standard atthe heart of these two problems was that settlement in physical gold is

cumbersome, expensive, and insecure, which meant it had to rely on
centralizing physical gold reserves in a few locations—banks and central
banks—leaving them vulnerable to being taken over by governments.
As the number of payments and settlements conducted in physical gold
becameaninfinitelysmallerfractionofallpayments,thebanksandcen-
tral banks holding the gold could create money unbacked by physical
gold and use it for settlement. The network of settlement became valu-
able enough that its owners’ credit was effectively monetized. As the
ability to run a bank started to imply money creation, governments
naturally gravitated to taking over the banking sector through central
banking. The temptation was always too strong, and the virtually infi-
nite financial wealth this secured could not only silence dissent, but also
finance propagandists to promote such ideas. Gold offered no mech-
anism for restraining the sovereigns, and had to rely on trust in them
not abusing the gold standard and the population remaining eternally
vigilant against them doing so. This might have been feasible when the
population was highly educated and knowledgeable about the dangers
of unsound money, but with every passing generation displaying theintellectual complacence that tends to accompany wealth,

Gold being centralized made it vulnerable to having its monetary
role usurped by its enemies, and gold simply had too many enemies, as
Mises himself well understood:
The nationalists are fighting the gold standard because they want to
sever their countries from the world market and to establish nationalautarky as far as possible. Interventionist governments and pressuregroups are fighting the gold standard because they consider it the

The twentieth century began with governments bringing their
citizens’ gold under their control through the invention of the modern
central bank on the gold standard. As World War I started, the cen-tralization of these reserves allowed these governments to expand the
money supply beyond their gold reserves, reducing the value of their
currency. Yet central banks continued to confiscate and accumulatemore gold until the 1960s, where the move toward a U.S. dollar global

gold, being highly prized for its industrial and aesthetic uses, would
be bought up very quickly with little depreciation of its price and the
central banks would be left without any gold reserves. The monetary
competition between easy government money and hard gold will likelyresult in one winner in the long-run. Even in a world of governmentmoney, governments have not been able to decree gold’s monetary role
away, as their actions speak louder than their words. (See Figure 4.

the choice decided by the free market, and the beginningof the era of government money. While gold continues
to underpin the global monetary system to this day, government edicts,
decisions, and monetary policy shape the monetary reality of the worldmore than any aspect of individual choice.
The common name for government money is fiat money ,f r o mt h e
Latinwordfordecree,order,orauthorization.Twoimportantfactsmustbe understood about government money from the outset. First, thereis a very large difference between government money redeemable in
gold, and irredeemable government money, even if both are run by the
government. Under a gold standard, money is gold, and governmentjust assumes a responsibility of minting standard units of the metal orprintingpaperbackedbythegold.Thegovernmenthasnocontroloverthe supply of gold in the economy, and people are able to redeem theirpaper in physical gold at any time, and use other shapes and forms of

another. With irredeemable government money, on the other hand, the
government’sdebtand/orpaperisusedasmoney,andthegovernmentisable to increase its supply as it sees fit. Should anybody use other forms
of money for exchange, or should they attempt to create more of the
government’s money, they run the risk of punishment.
The second and often overlooked fact, is that, contrary to what
the name might imply, no fiat money has come into circulation solelythrough government fiat; they were all originally redeemable in gold or
silver,orcurrenciesthatwereredeemableingoldorsilver.Onlythrough
redeemabilityintosalableformsofmoneydidgovernmentpapermoneygain its salability. Government may issue decrees mandating people usetheir paper for payments, but no government has imposed this salabil-ity on papers without these papers having first been redeemable in gold
and silver. Until this day, all government central banks maintain reserves
to back up the value of their national currency. The majority of coun-triesmaintainsomegoldintheirreserves,andthosecountrieswhichdonot have gold reserves maintain reserves in the form of other countries’
fiat currencies, which are in turn backed by gold reserves. No pure fiat
currency exists in circulation without any form of backing. Contraryto the most egregiously erroneous and central tenet of the state theoryof money, it was not government that decreed gold as money; rather, itis only by holding gold that governments could get their money to be
accepted at all.
The oldest recorded example of fiat money was jiaozi, a paper cur-
rencyissuedbytheSongdynastyinChinainthetenthcentury.Initially,jiaoziwas a receipt for gold or silver, but then government controlled its
issuanceandsuspendedredeemability,increasingtheamountofcurrency

1260, named chao, and exceeded the supply far beyond the metal back-
ing,withpredictablydisastrousconsequences.Asthevalueofthemoneycollapsed, the people fell into abject poverty, with many peasants resort-ing to selling their children into debt slavery.
Government money, then, is similar to primitive forms of money
discussed in Chapter 2, and commodities other than gold, in that it isliable to having its supply increased quickly compared to its stock, lead-ing to a quick loss of salability, destruction of purchasing power, andimpoverishmentofitsholders.Inthisrespectitdiffersfromgold,whoseTrim Size: 6in x 9in Ammous c04.tex V1 - 03/05/2018 1:08pm Page 43 k

Monetary Nationalism and the End
of the Free World
The many enemies of sound money whom Mises named in the quote
referenced at the end of the last chapter were to have their victory over
thegoldstandardwiththebeginningofasmallwarinCentralEuropein
1914,whichsnowballedintothefirstglobalwarinhumanhistory.Cer-
tainly,whenthewarstartednobodyhadenvisioneditlastingaslong,and
producing as many casualties, as it did. British newspapers, for example,
heralded it as the August Bank Holiday War, expecting it to be a sim-
ple triumphant summer excursion for their troops. There was a sense
thatthiswouldbealimitedconflict.And,afterdecadesofrelativepeace
across Europe, a new generation of Europeans had not grown to appre-
ciate the likelyconsequences of launching war. Today, historians still fail
toofferaconvincingstrategicorgeopoliticalexplanationforwhyacon-
flict between the Austro-Hungarian Empire and Serbian separatists was
to trigger a global war that claimed the lives of millions and drastically
reshaped most of the world’s borders.
In retrospect, the major difference between World War I and the
previous limited wars was neither geopolitical nor strategic, but rather,
it was monetary. When governments were on a gold standard, they had
direct control of large vaults of gold while their people were dealing
with paper receipts of this gold. The ease with which a government
could issue more paper currency was too tempting in the heat of the
conflict,andfareasierthandemandingtaxationfromthecitizens.Within
a few weeks of the war starting, all major belligerents had suspendedgold convertibility, effectively going off the gold standard and puttingTrim Size: 6in x 9in Ammous c04.tex V1 - 03/05/2018 1:08pm Page 44 k

their population on a fiat standard, wherein the money they used was
government-issued paper that was not redeemable for gold.
Withthesimplesuspensionofgoldredeemability,governments’war
efforts were no longer limited to the money that they had in their owntreasuries, but extended virtually to the entire wealth of the population.
For as long as the government could print more money and have that
money accepted by its citizens and foreigners, it could keep financingthe war. Previously, under a monetary system where gold as money was
in the hands of the people, government only had its own treasuries to
sustain its war effort, along with any taxation or bond issues to financethe war. This made conflict limited, and lay at the heart of the relatively
longperiodsofpeaceexperiencedaroundtheworldbeforethetwentieth
century.
Had European nations remained on the gold standard, or had the
people of Europe held their own gold in their own hands, forcing gov-
ernment to resort to taxation instead of inflation, history might havebeendifferent.ItislikelythatWorldWarIwouldhavebeensettledmil-
itarilywithinafewmonthsofconflict,asoneofthealliedfactionsstarted
running out of financing and faced difficulties in extracting wealth froma population that was not willing to part with its wealth to defend their
regime’s survival. But with the suspension of the gold standard, running
out of financing was not enough to end the war; a sovereign had to runout of its people’s accumulated wealth expropriated through inflation.
European countries devaluing their currency allowed the bloody
stalemate to continue for four years, with no resolution or advance-ment. The senselessness of it all was not lost on the populations of these
countries, and the soldiers on the front line risking their lives for no
apparent reason but the unbounded vanity and ambition of monarchswho were usually related and intermarried. In the most vivid personifi-
cation of the absolute senselessness of this war, on Christmas Eve 1914,
French, English, and German soldiers stopped following orders to fight,laiddowntheirarms,andcrossedthebattlelinestomingleandsocializewithoneanother.ManyoftheGermansoldiershadworkedinEngland

The geographic changes brought about by the war were hardly
worth the carnage, as most nations gained or lost marginal lands and no
victor could claim to have captured large territories worth the sacrifice.The Austro-Hungarian Empire was broken up into smaller nations,
but these remained ruled by their own people, and not the winners of

different currencies was merely the conversion between different
weights of gold, under monetary nationalism the money supply of eachcountry, and the exchange rate between them, was to be determined in
international agreements and meetings. Germany suffered from hyper-
inflationaftertheTreatyofVersailleshadimposedlargereparationsonitand it sought to repay them using inflation. Britain had major problemswith the flow of gold from its shores to France and the United States asit attempted to maintain a gold standard but with a rate that overvalued
the British pound and undervalued gold.
The first major treaty of the century of monetary nationalism was
the1922TreatyofGenoa.Underthetermsofthistreaty,theU.S.dollarand the British pound were to be considered reserve currencies similarto gold in their position in other countries’ reserves. With this move,
the U.K. had hoped to alleviate its problems with the overvalued ster-
ling by having other countries purchase large quantities of it to placein their reserves. The world’s major powers signaled their departurefrom the solidity of the gold standard toward inflationism as a solu-
tion to economic problems. The insanity of this arrangement was that
these governments wanted to inflate while also maintaining the priceof their currency stable in terms of gold at prewar levels. Safety wassought in numbers: if everyone devalued their currencies, there wouldbe nowhere for capital to hide. But this did not and could not work
and gold continued to flow out of Britain to the United States and
France.
The drain of gold from Britain is a little-known story with enor-
mous consequences. Liaquat Ahamed’s Lords of Finance focuses on this
episode, and does a good job of discussing the individuals involved and
the drama taking place, but adopts the reigning Keynesian understand-
ing of the issue, putting the blame for the entire episode on the goldstandard. In spite of his extensive research, Ahamed fails to compre-hend that the problem was not the gold standard, but that post-WorldWar I governments had wanted to return to the gold standard at the
pre-World War I rates. Had they admitted to their people the magni-
tude of the devaluation that took place to fight the war, and re-peggedtheir currencies to gold at new rates, there would have probably been arecessionary crash, after which the economy would have recovered on asound monetary basis.Trim Size: 6in x 9in Ammous c04.tex V1 - 03/05/2018 1:08pm Page 49 k

A better treatment of this episode, and its horrific aftermath, can be
found in Murray Rothbard’s America’sGreatDepression . As Britain’s gold
reserves were leaving its shores to places where they were better valued,the chief of the Bank of England, Sir Montagu Norman, leaned heav-ily on his French, German, and American counterparts to increase themoney supply in their countries, devaluing their paper currencies in the
hope that it would stem the flow of gold away from England. While the
French and German bankers were not cooperative, Benjamin Strong,chairman of the New York Federal Reserve, was, and he engaged ininflationary monetary policy throughout the 1920s. This may have suc-ceeded in reducing the outflow of gold from Britain up to a point, butthe most important implication of it was that it created a larger bubblein the housing and stock markets in the United States. The U.S. Fed’sinflationary policy ended by the end of 1928, at which point the U.S.economy was ripe for the inevitable collapse that follows from the sus-
pensionofinflationism.Whatfollowedwasthe1929stockmarketcrash,
and the reaction of the U.S. government turned that into the longestdepression in modern recorded history.
ThecommonstoryabouttheGreatDepressionpositsthatPresident
Hoover chose to remain inactive in the face of the downturn, due toa misplaced faith in the ability of free markets to bring about recov-ery, and adherence to the gold standard. Only when he was replacedby Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who moved to an activist governmen-tal role and suspended the gold standard, did the U.S. recovery ensue.
This, to put it mildly, is nonsense. Hoover not only increased govern-
ment spending on public work projects to fight the Depression, buthe also leaned on the Federal Reserve to expand credit, and made thefocus of his policy the insane quest to keep wages high in the face ofdeclining wage rates. Further, price controls were instituted to keeppricesofproducts,particularlyagricultural,athighlevels,similartowhatwas viewed as the fair and correct state that preceded the depression.The United States and all major global economies began to implementprotective trade policies that made matters far worse across the worldeconomy.

A precursory understanding of economics will make it clear that
price controls are always counterproductive, resulting in surpluses andshortages. The problems faced by the American economy in the 1930s
were inextricably linked to the fixing of wages and prices. Wages were

It was the abandonment of sound money and its replacement with
government-issued fiat which turned the world’s leading economies
into centrally planned and government-directed failures. As govern-
ments controlled money, they controlled most economic, political,
cultural, and educational activity. Having never studied economics or
researched it professionally, Keynes captured the zeitgeist of omnipotentgovernment to come up with the definitive track that gave govern-
ments what they wanted to hear. Gone were all the foundations of
economic knowledge acquired over centuries of scholarship around the
world, to be replaced with the new faith with the ever-so-convenient
conclusions that suited high time-preference politicians and totalitarian
governments: the state of the economy is determined by the lever of
aggregate spending, and any rise in unemployment or slowdown in
production had no underlying causes in the structure of production
or in the distortion of markets by central planners; rather it was all ashortage of spending, and the remedy is the debauching of the currency
and the increase of government spending. Saving reduces spending and
because spending is all that matters, government must do all it can to
deter its citizens from saving. Imports drive workers out of work, so
spending increases must go on domestic goods. Governments loved this
message, and Keynes himself knew that. His book was translated into
German in 1937, at the height of the Nazi era, and in the introduction
to the German edition Keynes wrote:

The Keynesian deluge, from which the world is yet to recover, had
begun. Universities lost their independence and became part and par-cel of the government’s ruling apparatus. Academic economics stopped
beinganintellectualdisciplinefocusedonunderstandinghumanchoices
under scarcity to improve their conditions. Instead it became an arm ofthe government, meant to direct policymakers toward the best policies
for managing economic activities. The notion that government man-
agement of the economy is necessary became the unquestioned startingpointofallmoderneconomiceducation,ascanbegleanedfromlooking
at any modern economics textbook, where government plays the same
role that God plays in religious scriptures: an omnipresent, omniscient,omnipotentforcethatmerelyneedstoidentifyproblemstosatisfactorilyaddress them. Government is immune to the concept of opportunity
costs, and rarely are the negative results of government intervention in
economic activity even considered, and if they are, it is only to justifyeven more government intervention. The classical liberal tradition that
viewed economic freedom as the foundation of economic prosperity
was quietly brushed aside as government propagandists masquerading aseconomists presented the Great Depression, caused and exacerbated by
government controls, as the refutation of free markets. Classical liber-
als were the enemies of the political regimes of the 1930s; murderedand chased away from Russia, Italy, Germany, and Austria, they were

Today government-approved economics curricula still blame the
gold standard for the Great Depression. The same gold standard whichproduced more than four decades of virtually uninterrupted global
growth and prosperity between 1870 and 1914 suddenly stopped
working in the 1930s because it wouldn’t allow governments to

expand their money supply to fight the depression, whose causes these
economists cannot explain beyond meaningless Keynesian allusions toanimal spirits. And none of these economists seem to notice that if the
problem was indeed the gold standard, then its suspension should have
caused the beginning of recovery. Instead, it took more than a decadeafter its suspension for growth to resume. The conclusion obvious toanyone with a basic understanding of money and economics is that
the cause of the Great Crash of 1929 was the diversion away from the
gold standard in the post-WWI years, and that the deepening of theDepression was caused by government control and socialization ofthe economy in the Hoover and FDR years. Neither the suspensionof the gold standard nor the wartime spending did anything to alleviate
the Great Depression.

the government-directed economies built were far more advanced
than any the world had ever seen, thanks to the popularity of themost dangerous and absurd of all Keynesian fallacies, the notion thatgovernment spending on military effort would aid economic recovery.All spending is spending, in the naive economics of Keynesians, andso it matters not if that spending comes from individuals feeding their
families or governments murdering foreigners: it all counts in aggregate
demand and it all reduces unemployment! As an increasing numberof people went hungry during the depression, all major governmentsspent generously on arming themselves, and the result was a return tothe senseless destruction of three decades earlier.
For Keynesian economists, the war was what caused economic
recovery, and if one looked at life merely through the lens of statisticalaggregates collected by government bureaucrats, such a ridiculousnotion is tenable. With government war expenditure and conscription
on the rise, aggregate expenditure soared while unemployment plum-
meted, so all countries involved in World War II had recovered becauseof their participation in the war. Anybody not afflicted with Keynesianeconomics, however, can realize that life during World War II, even incountries that did not witness war on their soil, like the United States,cannot by any stretch of the imagination be characterized as “economicrecovery.” On top of the death and destruction, the dedication of somuch of the capital and labor resources of the belligerent countriesto the war effort meant severe shortages of output at home, resulting
in rationing and price controls. In the United States, construction
of new housing and repair of existing housing were banned.

obviously, one cannot possibly argue that soldiers fighting and dyingat warfronts, who constituted a large percentage of the populations ofbelligerent nations, enjoyed any form of economic recovery, no matterhow much aggregate expenditure went into making the weapons theywere carrying.
But one of the most devastating blows to Keynesian theories of the
aggregate demand as the determinant of the state of the economy camein the aftermath of World War II, particularly in the United States.

A confluence of factors had conspired to reduce government spending
drastically, leading to Keynesian economists of the era predicting doomand gloom to follow the war: the end of military hostilities reduced
government military spending dramatically. The death of the populist
and powerful FDR and his replacement by the meeker and less iconicTruman, coming up against a Congress controlled by Republicans, cre-ated political deadlock that prevented the renewal of the statutes of theNew Deal. All of these factors together, when analyzed by Keynesianeconomists, would point to impending disaster, as Paul Samuelson, the
man who literally wrote the textbooks for economic education in the
postwar era, wrote in 1943:
The final conclusion to be drawn from our experience at the end of
the last war is inescapable—were the war to end suddenly within thenext 6 months, were we again planlessly to wind up our war effort inthe greatest haste, to demobilize our armed forces, to liquidate pricecontrols, to shift from astronomical deficits to even the large deficitsof the thirties—then there would be ushered in the greatest period ofunemploymentandindustrialdislocationwhichanyeconomyhaseverfaced.
10
The end of World War II and the dismantling of the New Deal
meant the U.S. government cut its spending by an astonishing 75%
between 1944 and 1948, and it also removed most price controls for
good measure. And yet, the U.S. economy witnessed an extraordinaryboomduringtheseyears.Theroughly10millionmenwhoweremobi-lized for the war came back home and were almost seamlessly absorbedinto the labor force, as economic production boomed, flying in the face

would continue to dog the world economy with crisis after crisis.
It is well-known that history is written by the victors, but in the era
of government money, victors get to decide on the monetary systems,
too. The United States summoned representatives of its allies to Bretton
Woods in New Hampshire to discuss formulating a new global trading
system. History has not been very kind to the architects of this sys-
tem.Britain’srepresentativewasnoneotherthanJohnMaynardKeynes,
whose economic teachings were to be wrecked on the shores of realityin the decades following the war, while America’s representative, Harry
Dexter White, would later be uncovered as a Communist who was in
contact with the Soviet regime for many years.
11In the battle for cen-
trally planned global monetary orders, White was to emerge victorious
with a plan that even made Keynes’s look not entirely unhinged. The
United States was to be the center of the global monetary system, with
itsdollarsbeingusedasaglobalreservecurrencybyothercentralbanks,whosecurrencieswouldbeconvertibletodollarsatfixedexchangerates,
while the dollar itself would be convertible to gold at a fixed exchange
rate. To facilitate this system, the United States would take gold from
other countries’ central banks.
11After being investigated and testifying in front of Congress, White suffered two heart attacks and
died from an overdose of medication, which may have been suicide. A good treatment of this episodecan be found in Benn Steil’s The Battle of Bretton Woods , which pushes the view that White was a
Soviet spy. An alternative reading of the situation can produce a more nuanced perspective, thoughhardly more flattering. The links between American progressives and Russian Communists precede the1917 Russian putsch, and included significant U.S. funding to the Bolsheviks to depose the Russianmonarchy, as thoroughly detailed by British–American historian Antony Sutton. Wilsonian Americanprogressives,whowerebehindtheLeagueofNationsandlatertheUnitedNations,hadsoughtaglobaldemocraticprogressivetechnocraticmanagerialworldgovernment,andsoughtcooperationwithglobalforces that would be supportive of this goal, and to depose reactionary monarchies that would notcooperate with this world order. Hence, American interests played a leading role in promoting theBolsheviks and helping them take power, particularly through Leon Trotsky, who was in New Yorkduringtherevolution,channelingfundingandarmstohiscomradesinRussia.WhereasTrotskywasaninternationalist socialist who wouldhavecooperatedwithAmericaninterests,hewas not togain powerin Russia, and instead Stalin was to succeed Lenin, and head in a more parochial direction, prioritizingsocialism at home over global cooperation. From then on, American progressives maintained contactwith Russian interests, attempting to sway Russia back into cooperation with American progressiveinterests, but to no avail. We can thus better understand White not as a Communist spy, but as anAmerican progressive who sought cooperation with Russian Bolsheviks for the grand project of the
postwar economic order the American progressives sought.Trim Size: 6in x 9in Ammous c04.tex V1 - 03/05/2018 1:08pm Page 57 k

Whereas the American people were still prohibited from owning
gold, the U.S. government promised to redeem dollars in gold to othercountries’ central banks at a fixed rate, opening what was known as thegold exchange window. In theory, the global monetary system was stillbasedongold,andiftheU.S.governmenthadmaintainedconvertibilitytogoldbynotinflatingthedollarsupplybeyondtheirgoldreserveswhile
other countries had not inflated their money supply beyond their dollar
reserves, the monetary system would have effectively been close to thegold standard of the pre-World War I era. They did not, of course, andin practice, the exchange rates were anything but fixed and provisionswere made for allowing governments to alter these rates to address a“fundamental disequilibrium.”
12
In order to manage this global system of hopefully fixed exchange
rates, and address any potential fundamental disequilibrium, the Bret-ton Woods conference established the International Monetary Fund,
which acted as a global coordination body between central banks with
the express aim of achieving stability of exchange rates and financialflows. In essence, Bretton Woods attempted to achieve through centralplanning what the international gold standard of the nineteenth cen-tury had achieved spontaneously. Under the classical gold standard themonetary unit was gold while capital and goods flowed freely betweencountries, spontaneously adjusting flows without any need for centralcontrol or direction, and never resulting in balance of payment crises:whatever amount of money or goods moved across borders did so at
the discretion of its owners and no macroeconomic problems could
emerge.
In the Bretton Woods system, however, governments were domi-
nated by Keynesian economists who viewed activist fiscal and monetarypolicyasanaturalandimportantpartofgovernmentpolicy.Theconstantmonetary and fiscal management would naturally lead to the fluctua-tion of the value of national currencies, resulting in imbalances in tradeand capital flows. When a country’s currency is devalued, its productsbecome cheaper to foreigners, leading to more goods leaving the coun-try, while holders of the currency seek to purchase foreign currencies to

dynamic for the two governments. No such problems could exist with
the gold standard, where the value of the currency in both countrieswas constant, because it was gold, and movements of goods and capitalwould not affect the value of the currency.
The automatic adjustment mechanisms of the gold standard had
always provided a constant measuring rod against which all economic
activity was measured, but the floating currencies gave the worldeconomy imbalances. The International Monetary Fund’s role was toperformanimpossiblebalancingactbetweenalltheworld’sgovernments
to attempt to find some form of stability or “equilibrium” in this mess,
keeping exchange rates within some arbitrary range of predeterminedvalues while trade and capital flows were moving and altering them.But without a stable unit of account for the global economy, this was atask as hopeless as attempting to build a house with an elastic measuring
tape whose own length varied every time it was used.
AlongwiththeestablishmentoftheWorldBankandIMFinBretton
Woods,theUnitedStatesanditsallieswantedtoestablishanotherinter-national financial institution to specialize in arranging trade policy. Theinitial attempt to establish an International Trade Organization failed
after the U.S. Congress refused to ratify the treaty, but a replacementwas
sought in the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs, commencing in1948. GATT was meant to help the IMF in the impossible task of bal-ancing budgets and trade to ensure financial stability—in other words,centrally planning global trade and fiscal and monetary policy to remain
in balance, as if such a thing were possible.
An important, but often overlooked, aspect of the Bretton Woods
system was that most of the member countries had moved largeamounts of their gold reserves to the United States and received dollarsin exchange, at a rate of $35 per ounce. The rationale was that the U.S.Trim Size: 6in x 9in Ammous c04.tex V1 - 03/05/2018 1:08pm Page 59 k

dollar would be the global currency for trade and central banks would
trade through it and settle their accounts in it, obviating the need forthe physical movement of gold. In essence, this system was akin to the
entire world economy being run as one country on a gold standard,
with the U.S. Federal Reserve acting as the world’s central bank and allthe world’s central banks as regional banks, the main difference beingthat the monetary discipline of the gold standard was almost entirelylost in this world where there were no effective controls on all central
banksinexpandingthemoneysupply,becausenocitizenscouldredeem
their government money for gold. Only governments could redeemtheir dollars in gold from the United States, but that was to prove farmore complicated than expected. Today, each ounce of gold for whichforeign central banks received $35 is worth in excess of $1,200.
Monetary expansionism became the new global norm, and the ten-
uous link that the system had to gold proved powerless to stop thedebauching of global currencies and the constant balance of paymentcrises affecting most countries. The United States, however, was put in
a remarkable position, similar to, though massively exceeding in scope,
the Roman Empire’s pillaging and inflating the money supply used bymostoftheOldWorld.Withitscurrencydistributedallovertheworld,andcentralbankshavingtoholditasareservetotradewithoneanother,the U.S. government could accrue significant seniorage from expanding
the supply of dollars, and also had no reason to worry about running a
balance of payment deficit. French economist Jacques Reuff coined thephrase “deficit without tears” to describe the new economic reality thattheUnitedStatesinhabited,whereitcouldpurchasewhateveritwantedfrom the world and finance it through debt monetized by inflating the
currency that the entire world used.
The relative fiscal restraint of the first few years after World War II
soon gave way to the politically irresistible temptation of buying freelunches through inflation, particularly to the warfare and welfare states.The military industry that prospered during World War II grew into

Keynesianism claimed this spending would be good for the economy,

Government Money’s Track Record
The tenuous link of gold exchangeability was an annoying detail for
the U.S. government’s inflationism, and it manifested in two symptoms:first, the global gold market was always seeking to reflect the reality of
inflationism through a higher gold price. This was addressed through
the establishment of the London Gold Pool, which sought to drop theprice of gold by offloading some of the gold reserves that governmentsheld onto the market. This worked only temporarily, but in 1968, theU.S. dollar had to start getting revalued compared to gold to acknowl-edge the years of inflation it had suffered. The second problem was that
some countries started trying to repatriate their gold reserves from the
United States as they started to recognize the diminishing purchasingpower of their paper money. French president Charles de Gaulle evensentaFrenchmilitarycarriertoNewYorktogethisnation’sgoldback,but when the Germans attempted to repatriate their gold, the UnitedStates had decided it had had enough. Gold reserves were running low,

of dollar convertibility to gold, thus letting the gold price float in the
market freely. In effect, the United States had defaulted on its commit-ment to redeem its dollars in gold. The fixed exchange rates betweentheworld’scurrencies,whichtheIMFwastaskedwithmaintaining,hadnow been let loose to be determined by the movement of goods andcapital across borders and in ever-more-sophisticated foreign exchange
markets.
Freed from the final constraints of the pretense of gold redemption,
the U.S. government expanded its monetary policy in unprecedentedscale, causing a large drop in the purchasing power of the dollar, anda rise in prices across the board. Everyone and everything was blamedfor the rise in prices by the U.S. government and its economists, exceptfor the one actual source of the price rises, the increase in the supplyof the U.S. dollar. Most other currencies fared even worse, as they werethe victim of inflation of the U.S. dollars backing them, as well as the
inflation by the central banks issuing them.
This move by President Nixon completed the process begun with
World War I, transforming the world economy from a global gold stan-dard to a standard based on several government-issued currencies.

economies, which have witnessed faster price rises and several hyperin-

Hyperinflation is a far more pernicious phenomenon than just the
loss of a lot of economic value by a lot of people; it constitutes a com-
plete breakdown of the structure of economic production of a soci-
ety built up over centuries and millennia. With the collapse of money,it becomes impossible to trade, produce, or engage in anything otherthan scraping for the bare essentials of life. As the structures of pro-
duction and trade that societies have developed over centuries break
down due to the inability of consumers, producers, and workers to payone another, the goods which humans take for granted begin to dis-appear. Capital is destroyed and sold off to finance consumption. Firstgo the luxury goods, but soon follow the basic essentials of survival,
until humans are brought back to a barbaric state wherein they need to
fend for themselves and struggle to secure the most basic needs of sur-vival. As the individual’s quality of life degenerates markedly, despairbegins to turn to anger, scapegoats are sought, and the most dema-gogicandopportunisticpoliticianstakeadvantageofthissituation,stok-

The problem with government-provided money is that its hardness
depends entirely on the ability of those in charge to not inflate its sup-ply.Onlypoliticalconstraintsprovidehardness,andtherearenophysical,economic, or natural constraints on how much money government can
produce. Cattle, silver, gold, and seashells all require serious effort to
produce them and can never be generated in large quantities at the dropof a hat, but government money requires only the fiat of the govern-
ment. The constantly increasing supply means a continuous devaluation
of the currency, expropriating the wealth of the holders to benefit thosewho print the currency, and those who receive it earliest.

Should a currency credibly demonstrate its supply cannot be
expanded, it would immediately gain value significantly. In 2003, when
the United States invaded Iraq, aerial bombardment destroyed theIraqi central bank and with it the capability of the Iraqi government
to print new Iraqi dinars. This led to the dinar drastically appreciating
overnight as Iraqis became more confident in the currency given thatno central bank could print it anymore.
20A similar story happened to
Somali shillings after their central bank was destroyed.21Money is more
desirable when demonstrably scarce than when liable to being debased.
A few reasons keep government money as the prime money of our
time. First, governments mandate that taxes are paid in governmentmoney, which means individuals are highly likely to accept it, giving
it an edge in its salability. Second, government control and regulation of
the banking system means that banks can only open accounts and trans-act in government-sanctioned money, thus giving government money
a much higher degree of salability than any other potential competi-
tor. Third, legal tender laws make it illegal in many countries to useother forms of money for payment. Fourth, all government moneysare still backed by gold reserves, or backed by currencies backed by
gold reserves. According to data from the World Gold Council, cen-
tral banks currently have around 33,000 tons of gold in their reserves.Central bank gold reserves rose quickly in the early part of the twenti-eth century as many governments confiscated their people’s and banks’
gold and forced them to use their money. In the late 1960s, with the
Bretton Woods system straining under the pressure of increased moneysupply, governments began to offload some of their gold reserves. But
in 2008 that trend reversed and central banks returned to buying gold
and the global supply has increased. It is ironic, and very telling, that inthe era of government money, governments themselves own far moregold in their official reserves than they did under the international gold
standard of 1871–1914. Gold has clearly not lost its monetary role; it

remains the only final extinguisher of debt, the one money whose value
is not a liability of anyone else, and the prime global asset which carriesno counterparty risk. Access to its monetary role, however, has been
restricted to central banks, while individuals have been directed toward
using government money.
Central banks’ large reserves of gold can be used as an emergency
supplytosellorleaseonthegoldmarkettopreventthepriceofgoldfromrising during periods of increased demand, to protect the monopoly

22(See Figure 4.23)
As technology has progressed to allow for ever-more-sophisticated
forms of money, including paper money that is easy to carry around, a
new problem of salability has been introduced, and that is the ability ofthe seller to sell her good without the intervention of any third partiesthat might place restraints on the salability of that money. This is notan issue that exists with commodity moneys, whose market value is
emergent from the market and cannot be dictated by third parties to
the transaction: cattle, salt, gold, and silver all have a market and willingbuyers. But with government-issued money with negligible value asa commodity, salability can be compromised by the governments thatissued it, declaring it no longer suitable as legal tender. Indians who
woke up on November 8, 2016, to hear that their government had
suspended the legal tender status of 500 and 1,000 rupee notes cancertainly relate. In the blink of an eye, what was highly salable moneylost its value and had to be exchanged at banks with very long lines.And as more of the world heads toward reducing its reliance on cash,
more of people’s money is being placed in government-supervised
banks, making it vulnerable to confiscation or capital controls. The factthat these procedures generally happen during times of economic crisis,when individuals need that money most, is a major impediment to the
salability of government-issued money.

Government control of money has turned money from being the
reward for producing value to the reward for obedience to governmentofficials. It is impractical for anyone to develop wealth in governmentmoney without government acceptance. Government can confiscatemoney from the banking monopolies it controls, inflate the currency todevalue holders’ wealth and reward it to the most loyal of its subjects,impose draconian taxes and punish those who avoid them, and even
confiscate bills.
Whereas in Austrian economist Menger’s time the criteria for
determining what is the best money revolved around understandingsalability and what the market would choose as money, in the twentiethcentury, government control of money has meant a new and veryimportant criterion being added to salability, and that is the salabilityof money according to the will of its holder and not some other party.Combiningthesecriteriatogetherformulatesacompleteunderstandingof the term sound money as the money that is chosen by the market
freely and the money completely under the control of the personwho earned it legitimately on the free market and not any other thirdparty.
While a staunch defender of the role of gold as money during his
time, Ludwig von Mises understood that this monetary role was not
something inherent or intrinsic to gold. As one of the deans of theAustrian tradition in economics, Mises well understood that value doesnotexistoutsideofhumanconsciousness,andthatmetalsandsubstanceshadnothinginherenttothemthatcouldassigntothemamonetaryrole.ForMises,gold’smonetarystatuswasduetoitsfulfillmentofthecriteriafor sound money as he understood them:
[T]he sound money principle has two aspects. It is affirmative in
approving the market’s choice of a commonly used medium ofexchange. It is negative in obstructing the government’s propensity tomeddle with the currency system.
24
Sound money, then, according to Mises, is what the market freely
chooses to be money, and what remains under the control of its owner,

safe from coercive meddling and intervention. For as long as the money
was controlled by anyone other than the owner, whoever controlledit would always face too strong an incentive to pilfer the value of the
money through inflation or confiscation, and to use it as a political
tool to achieve their political goals at the expanse of the holders. This,in effect, takes wealth away from people who produce it and gives itto people who specialize in the control of money without actuallyproducing things valued by society, in the same way European traders
could pilfer African society by flooding them with cheap beads as
mentioned in Chapter 2. No society could prosper when such anavenue for riches remained open, at the cost of impoverishing thosewho seek productive avenues for wealth. A sound money, on theother hand, makes service valuable to others the only avenue open for
prosperityto anyone, thus concentrating society’s effortson production,
cooperation, capital accumulation, and trade.
The twentieth century was the century of unsound money and
the omnipotent state, as a market choice in money was denied by
government diktat, and government-issued paper money was forced
on people with the threat of violence. As time passed, governmentsmoved away from s oundmoneyevermoreastheirspendinganddeficits
increased, their currencies continuously devalued, and an ever-largershare of national income was controlled by the government. With
government increasing its meddling in all aspects of life, it increasingly
controlled the educational system and used it to imprint in people’sminds the fanciful notion that the rules of economics did not apply togovernments, which would prosper the more they spent. The workof monetary cranks like John Maynard Keynes taught in modern
universities the notion that government spending only has benefits,
never costs. The government, after all, can always print money and sofaces no real constraints on its spending, which it can use to achievewhichever goal the electorate sets for it.

Money and Time
Preference
Sound money is chosen freely on the market for its salability,
because it holds its value across time, because it can transfer
value effectively across space, and because it can be divided and
grouped into small and large scales. It is money whose supply cannot
be manipulated by a coercive authority that imposes its use on others.
Fromtheprecedingdiscussion,andfromtheunderstandingofmonetary
economics afforded to us by Austrian economics, the importance of
sound money can be explained for three broad reasons: first, it protectsvalue across time, which gives people a bigger incentive to think of
their future, and lowers their time preference. The lowering of the time
preference is what initiates the process of human civilization and allowsfor humans to cooperate, prosper, and live in peace. Second, sound
money allows for trade to be based on a stable unit of measurement,
facilitating ever-larger markets, free from government control and coer-cion, and with free trade comes peace and prosperity. Further, a unit of

account is essential for all forms of economic calculation and planning,
and unsound money makes economic calculation unreliable and is theroot cause of economic recessions and crises. Finally, sound money is
an essential requirement for individual freedom from despotism and
repression, as the ability of a coercive state to create money can giveit undue power over its subjects, power which by its very nature willattract the least worthy, and most immoral, to take its reins.
Soundmoneyisaprimefactorindeterminingindividual time prefer-
ence,anenormouslyimportantandwidelyneglectedaspectofindividual
decision making. Time preference refers to the ratio at which individ-uals value the present compared to the future. Because humans do notlive eternally, death could come to us at any point in time, making thefuture uncertain. And because consumption is necessary for survival,
people always value present consumption more than future consump-
tion, as the lack of present consumption could make the future neverarrive. In other words, time preference is positive for all humans; thereis always a discount on the future compared to the present.
Further, because more goods can be produced with time and
resources, rational individuals would always prefer to have a givenquantity of resources in the present than in the future, as they coulduse them to produce more. For an individual to be willing to deferher receipt of a good by a year, she would have to be offered a larger
quantity of the good. The increase necessary to tempt an individual to
delay her receipt of the good is what determines her time preference.All rational individuals have a nonzero time preference, but the timepreference varies from one individual to another.
Animals’ time preference is far higher than humans’, as they act to
the satisfaction of their immediate instinctive impulses and have little
conception of the future. A few animals are capable of building nests orhomesthatcanlastforthefuture,andthesehavealowertimepreferencethan the animals that act to the satisfaction of their immediate needssuch as hunger and aggression. Human beings’ lower time preference
allows us to curb our instinctive and animalistic impulses, think of what
isbetterforourfuture,andactrationallyratherthanimpulsively.Insteadof spending all our time producing goods for immediate consumption,we can choose to spend time engaged in production of goods that willtake longer to complete, if they are superior goods.

their time preference, they develop the scope for carrying out tasks over
longer time horizons, for satisfaction of ever-more remote needs, and
they develop the mental capacity to create goods not for immediate
consumption but for the production of future goods, in other words,to create capital goods .
Whereas animals and humans can both hunt, humans differentiated
themselves from animals by spending time developing tools for hunting.
Some animals may occasionally use a tool in hunting another animal,
but they have no capacity for owning these tools and maintaining themfor long-term use. Only through a lower time preference can a human
decidetotaketimeawayfrom huntinganddedicatethattimetobuilding

ductionofcapitalgoodswhichwillmakeproductionmoresophisticated
or technologically advanced and extend it over a longer time-horizon.
The only reason that an individual would choose to delay his gratifica-tion to engage in risky production over a longer period of time is that
these longer processes will generate more output and superior goods. In
other words, investment raises the productivity of the producer .
Economist Hans-Hermann Hoppe explains that once time pref-
erence drops enough to allow for any savings and capital or durable
consumer-goods formation at all, the tendency is for time preference
to drop even further as a “process of civilization” is initiated.

The fisherman who builds a fishing rod is able to catch more fish
per hour than the fisherman hunting with his bare hands. But the only
way to build the fishing rod is to dedicate an initial amount of time to
work that does not produce edible fish, but instead produces a fishingrod. This is an uncertain process, for the fishing rod might not work
and the fisherman will have wasted his time to no avail. Not only does
investment require delaying gratification, it also always carries with it a
riskoffailure,whichmeanstheinvestmentwillonlybeundertakenwith
an expectation of a reward. The lower an individual’s time preference,the more likely he is to engage in investment, to delay gratification, and

now only needs one hour of fishing to secure her food for a day, and
so she dedicates the rest of her time to even more capital accumulation,building better and bigger fishing rods, nets, and boats, which in turnincreases her productivity further and improves the quality of her life.

An important demonstration of the importance of time preference
comes from the famous Stanford marshmallow experiment,
2conducted
in the late 1960s. Psychologist Walter Mischel would leave children ina room with a piece of marshmallow or a cookie, and tell the kidsthey were free to have it if they wanted, but that he will come back in15 minutes, and if the children had not eaten the candy, he would offerthem a second piece as a reward.

As an economics professor, I make sure to teach the marshmallow
experiment in every course I teach, as I believe it is the single most
important lesson economics can teach to individuals, and am astoundedthat university curricula in economics have almost entirely ignored thislesson, to the point that many academic economists have no familiaritywith the term time preference altogether or its significance.
While microeconomics has focused on transactions between
individuals, and macroeconomics on the role of government in theeconomy, the reality is that the most important economic decisions toany individual’s well-being are the ones they conduct in their trade-offswith their future self. Every day, an individual will conduct a few

economic transactions with other people, but they will partake in a far
larger number of transactions with their future self. The examples ofthese trades are infinite: deciding to save money rather than spend it;
deciding to invest in acquiring skills for future employment rather than

In each of these examples, there is nobody forcing the decision on
theindividual,andtheprimebeneficiaryorloserfromtheconsequencesof these choices is the individual himself. The main factor determin-ing a man’s choices in life is his time preference. While people’s time
preference and self-control will vary from one situation to the other, in
general, a strong correlation can be found across all aspects of decisionmaking. The sobering reality to keep in mind is that a man’s lot in lifewill be largely determined by these trades between him and his future
self.Asmuchashe’dliketoblameothersforhisfailures,orcreditothers
with his success, the infinite trades he took with himself are likely tobe more significant than any outside circumstances or conditions. Nomatter how circumstances conspire against the man with a low timepreference, he will probably find a way to keep prioritizing his future
self until he achieves his objectives. And no matter how much fortune
favors the man with a high time preference, he will find a way to con-tinue sabotaging and shortchanging his future self. The many stories ofpeople who have triumphed against all odds and unfavorable circum-stances stand in stark contrast to the stories of people blessed with skills

There are many factors that come into play in determining the time
preference of individuals.
3Security of people in their person and prop-
erty is arguably one of the most important. Individuals who live in areasofconflictandcrimewillhaveasignificantchanceoflosingtheirlifeand
are thus likely to more highly discount the future, resulting in a higher
time preference than those who live in peaceful societies. Security ofpropertyisanothermajorfactorinfluencingindividuals’timepreference:societieswheregovernmentsorthievesarelikelytoexpropriateindivid-uals’ property capriciously would have higher time preference, as suchactions would drive individuals to prioritize spending their resources onimmediate gratification rather than investing them in property which
could be appropriated at any time. Tax rates will also adversely affect
time preference: the higher the taxes, the less of their income that indi-viduals are allowed to keep; this would lead to individuals working lessatthemarginandsavinglessfortheirfuture,becausetheburdenoftaxesismorelikelytoreducesavingsthanconsumption,particularlyforthosewith a low income, most of which is needed for basic survival.

run is less likely to cheat, lie, or steal, because the reward for such activ-
ities may be positive in the short run, but can be devastatingly negativein the long run.
The reduction in the purchasing power of money is similar to a
form of taxation or expropriation, reducing the real value of one’s
money even while the nominal value is constant. In modern economiesgovernment-issued money is inextricably linked to artificially lowerinterest rates, which is a desirable goal for modern economists becauseitpromotesborrowingandinvesting.Buttheeffectofthismanipulation

The move from money that holds its value or appreciates to
money that loses its value is very significant in the long run: societysaves less, accumulates less capital, and possibly begins to consume its

Monetary Inflation
The simple reality, demonstrated throughout history, is that any personwho finds a way to create the monetary medium will try to do it. Thetemptationtoengageinthisistoostrong,butthecreationofthemone-tarymediumisnotanactivitythatisproductivetosociety,asanysupplyof money is sufficient for any economy of any size. The more that a
monetary medium restrains this drive for its creation, the better it is as
a medium of exchange and stable store of value. Unlike all other goods,money’s functions as a medium of exchange, store of value, and unitof account are completely orthogonal to its quantity. What matters inmoney is its purchasing power, not its quantity, and as such, any quan-tity of money is enough to fulfil the monetary functions, as long as it isdivisibleandgroupableenoughtosatisfyholders’transactionandstorage
needs. Any quantity of economic transactions could be supported by a
money supply of any size as long as the units are divisible enough.

of which more cannot be created. Whatever gets chosen as a mediumof exchange will appreciate in value and lead to more people trying toproduce more of it. The best form of money in history was the onethat would cause the new supply of money to be the least significant
compared to the existing stockpiles, and thus make its creation not a
good sourceof profit.Seeingasgold isindestructible,it isthe one metalwhose stockpiles have only been growing since the first human minedit. Seeing as this mining has been going on for thousands of years, andalchemy has yet to prove large-scale commercial viability, new mining
supply continues to be a reliably tiny fraction of existing stockpiles.
Thispropertyiswhygoldhasbeensynonymouswithsoundmoney:
it is money whose supply is guaranteed, thanks to the ironclad rules ofphysics and chemistry, to never be significantly increased. Try as they
might, humans have for centuries failed to produce a form of money
more sound than gold, and that is why it has been the prime mone-tary instrument used by most human civilizations throughout history.Even as the world has transitioned to government money as a store ofvalue, medium of exchange, and unit of account, governments them-
selves continue to hold a significant percentage of their reserves in gold,
constituting a significant percentage of total gold supply.
Keynes complained about goldmining being a wasteful activity that
consumed a lot of resources while adding nothing to real wealth. Whilehis critique does contain a kernel of truth, in the sense that increasing
the supply of the monetary medium does not increase the wealth of
the society using it, he misses the point that gold’s monetary role is aresult of it being the metal likely to attract the leasthuman and capi-
tal resources toward its mining and prospecting, compared to all others.Becausethesupplyofgoldcanonlybeincreasedbyverysmallquantities,

The reality of monetary competition constantly has disadvantaged
individuals and societies that invest their savings in metals other than
gold while rewarding those who invest their savings in gold, because it

4The folly of Keynes con-
demninggoldasmoneybecauseitsminingiswastefulisthatitisthe least
wasteful of all potential metals to use as money. But the folly is doubly
compounded by Keynes’s “solution” to this shortcoming of gold being
to propose a fiat monetary standard which has ended up dedicating far
more human time, labor, and resources toward the management of the
issuance of the money supply and the profiting from it. Never in the
history of gold as a monetary medium did it employ as many minersand workers as today’s central banks and all the associated banks and
businesses profiting from having close access to the monetary printing
presses, as will be discussed in Chapter 7.
When new supply is insignificant compared to existing supply, the
market value of a form of money is determined through people’s will-
ingness to hold money and their desire to spend it. Such factors will
vary significantly with time for each individual, as individuals’ personalcircumstances go from periods where they prioritize holding a lot of

money to periods of holding less. But in the aggregate, they will vary
slightly for society as a whole, because money is the market good withthe least diminishing marginal utility . One of the fundamental laws of
economics is the law of diminishing marginal utility, which means that
acquiring more of any good reduces the marginal utility of each extraunit.Money,whichisheldnotforitsownsake,butforthesakeofbeingexchanged with other goods, will have its utility diminish slower thanany other good, because it can always be exchanged for any other good.
As an individual’s holdings of houses, cars, TVs, apples, or diamonds
increases, the marginal valuation they put on each extra unit decreases,leading to a decreasing desire to accumulate more of each. But moremoney is not like any of these goods, because as more of it is held, theholder can simply exchange the money for more of the next good they
value the most. The marginal utility of money does in fact decline, as
evidenced by the fact that an extra dollar of income means a lot moreto a person whose daily income is $1 than one whose daily income is$1,000. But money’s marginal utility declines far slower than any other
good,becauseitdeclinesalongwiththeutilityofwantinganygood,not
one particular good.
The slowly declining marginal utility of holding money means
demand for money at the margin will not vary significantly. Combiningthis with an almost constant supply results in a relatively stable market
value for money in terms of goods and services. This means money
is unlikely to appreciate or depreciate significantly, making it a lousylong-term investment but a good store of value. An investment wouldbe expected to have a significant appreciation potential, but also carry asignificant risk of loss or depreciation. Investment is a reward for taking
risk, but sound money, having the least risk, offers no reward.
In the aggregate, demand for money will likely vary only with vari-
ance in time preference. As people develop a lower time preferenceoverall, more people are likely to want to hold money, causing a rise initsmarketvaluecomparedtoothergoodsandservices,furtherrewarding

in terms of commodities, Jastram finds gold dropping in purchasing
power during the first 140 years, but then remaining relatively stable
from 1700 to 1914, when Britain went off the gold standard. For more
than two centuries during which Britain primarily used gold as money,
its purchasing power remained relatively constant, as did the price of
wholesale commodities. After Britain effectively went off the gold stan-dardinthewakeofWorldWarI,thepurchasingpowerofgoldincreased,
as did the index of wholesale prices. (See Figure 8.

It’s important to understand that for a monetary medium to remain
perfectly constant in value is not even theoretically possible or deter-
minable. Goods and services which money purchases will change overtime as new technologies introduce new goods that replace old ones,
and as the conditions of supply and demand of different goods will vary
over time. One of the prime functions of the monetary unit is to serve
as the unit of measure for economic goods, whose value is constantly
changing. It is thus not possible to satisfactorily measure the price of a

More recent data from the United States, focused on the last two
centuries,whichwitnessedfastereconomicgrowththantheperiodcov-
ered in Jastram’s data, shows that gold has even increased in value interms of commodities, whose prices rose dramatically in terms of U.S.
dollars. This is perfectly consistent with gold being the hardest money
available. It is easier to keep increasing the supply of all commodities
than gold, and so over time, all these other commodities will become
relatively more abundant than gold, causing a rise in gold’s purchasing
power over time. As can be seen in Figure 9,

inelastic while societal demand for money varies little over time as time
preference varies. Easy money, on the other hand, because of the abil-
ity of its producers to vary its quantity drastically, will engender widely
fluctuating demand from holders as the quantity varies and its reliabilityas a store of value falls and rises.
Relative stability of value is not just important to preserve the pur-
chasing power of holders’ savings, it is arguably more important forpreservingtheintegrityofthemonetaryunitasaunitofaccount.When
money is predictably stable in value due to the small variation in supply
and demand, it can act as a reliable signal for changes in prices of othergoods and services, as was the case with gold.
In the case of government money, on the other hand, the money
supplyincreasesthroughtheexpansionofthesupplybythecentralbankand commercial banks, and contracts through deflationary recessions
and bankruptcies, while the demand for money can vary even more
unpredictably depending on people’s expectations of the value ofthe money and the policies of the central bank. This highly volatile
combination results in government money being unpredictable in value
overthelongterm.Centralbanks’missionofensuringpricestabilityhasthem constantly managing the supply of money through their various
tools to ensure price stability, making many major currencies appear
less volatile in the short run compared to gold. But in the long run,the constant increase in the supply of government money compared to
gold’s steady and slow increase makes gold’s value more predictable.
Soundmoney,chosenonafreemarketpreciselyforitslikelihoodto

money whose use is enforced through government coercion. Had gov-
ernment money been a superior unit of account and store of value, itwould not need government legal tender laws to enforce it, nor wouldgovernments worldwide have had to confiscate large quantities of gold
and continue to hold them in their central bank reserves. The fact that
central banks continue to hold onto their gold, and have even startedincreasing their reserves, testifies to the confidence they have in their
own currencies in the long term, and in the inescapable monetary role
of gold as the value of paper currencies continues to plumb new depths.Trim Size: 6in x 9in Ammous c05.tex V1 - 03/05/2018 1:08pm Page 90 k

One of the key problems caused by a currency whose value is diminish-
ingisthatitnegativelyincentivizessavingforthefuture.Timepreferenceisuniversallypositive:giventhechoicebetweenthesamegoodtodayorin the future, any sane person would prefer to have it today. Only byincreasing the return in the future will people consider delaying grati-fication. Sound money is money that gains in value slightly over time,
meaning that holding onto it is likely to offer an increase in purchas-
ing power. Unsound money, being controlled by central banks whoseexpress mission is to keep inflation positive, will offer little incentivefor holders to keep it, as they become more likely to spend it or toborrow it.
When it comes to investment, sound money creates an economic
environment where any positive rate of return will be favorable to theinvestor, as the monetary unit is likely to hold onto its value, if notappreciate, thus strengthening the incentive to invest. With unsoundmoney, on the other hand, only returns that are higher than the rateof depreciation of the currency will be positive in real terms, creat-
ing incentives for high-return but high-risk investment and spending.
Further, as increases in the money supply effectively mean low interestrates, the incentive to save and invest is diminished while the incentiveto borrow increases.
The track record of the 46-year experiment with unsound money
bears out this conclusion. Savings rates have been declining across thedevelopedcountries,droppingtoverylowlevels,whilepersonal,munic-ipal,andnationaldebtshaveincreasedtolevelswhichwouldhaveseemedunimaginable in the past. (See Figure 12.

fall of almost three-quarters.
While savings rates have plummeted across the western world,
indebtedness continues to rise. The average household in the West isindebted by more than 100% of its annual income, while the total debtburden of the various levels of government and households exceeds
GDP by multiples, with significant consequences. Such numbers have
become normalized as Keynesian economists assure citizens that debt isgood for growth and that saving would result in recessions. One of themost mendacious fantasies that pervades Keynesian economic thoughtis the idea that the national debt “does not matter, since we owe it toourselves.” Only a high-time-preference disciple of Keynes could failto understand that this “ourselves” is not one homogeneous blob but is
differentiated into several generations—namely, the current ones which
consume recklessly at the expense of future ones. To make mattersworse, this phrase is usually followed by emotional blackmail along thelines of “we would be short-changing ourselves if we didn’t borrow toinvest for our future.”
Many pretend this is a miraculous modern discovery from Keynes’s
brilliant insight that spending is all that matters, and that by ensuringspending remains high, debts can continue to grow indefinitely and
savings can be eliminated. In reality, there is nothing new in this policy,
which was employed by the decadent emperors of Rome during its

decline, except that it is being applied with government-issued paper
money. Indeed, paper money allows it to be managed a little moresmoothly, and less obviously, than the metallic coins of old. But the
results are the same.
The twentieth century’s binge on conspicuous consumption cannot
be understood separately from the destruction of sound money andthe outbreak of Keynesian high-time-preference thinking, in vilifyingsavings and deifying consumption as the key to economic prosperity.
The reduced incentive to save is mirrored with an increased incentive
to spend, and with interest rates regularly manipulated downwardsand banks able to issue more credit than ever, lending stopped beingrestricted to investment, but has moved on to consumption. Creditcards and consumer loans allow individuals to borrow for the sake of
consumption without even the pretense of performing investment in
the future. It is an ironic sign of the depth of modern-day economicignorance fomented by Keynesian economics that capitalism—aneconomic system based on capital accumulation from saving—is blamed
for unleashing conspicuous consumption—the exact opposite of capital
accumulation. Capitalism is what happens when people drop theirtime preference, defer immediate gratification, and invest in the future.Debt-fueled mass consumption is as much a normal part of capitalismas asphyxiation is a normal part of respiration.
This also helps explain one of the key Keynesian misunderstand-
ings of economics, which considers that delaying current consumptionby saving will put workers out of work and cause economic produc-tion to stall. Keynes viewed the level of spending at any point in timeas being the most important determinant of the state of the economy
because,havingstudiednoeconomics,hehadnounderstandingofcap-
ital theory and how employment does not only have to be in finalgoods, but can also be in the production of capital goods which willonly produce final goods in the future. And having lived off of his fam-ily’s considerable fortune without having to work real jobs, Keynes had
no appreciation of saving or capital accumulation and their essential
role in economic growth. Hence, Keynes would observe a recessionconcurrently with a fall in consumer spending and increase in saving,and assume the causality runs from increased savings to decreased con-sumption to recession. Had he had the temperament to study capitalTrim Size: 6in x 9in Ammous c05.tex V1 - 03/05/2018 1:08pm Page 93 k

theory, he would have understood that the decreased consumption was
a natural reaction to the business cycle, which was in turn caused bythe expansion of the money supply, as will be discussed in Chapter 6.
Hewouldalsohaveunderstoodthattheonlycauseofeconomicgrowth
in the first place is delayed gratification, saving, and investment, whichextend the length of the production cycle and increase the productivityof the methods of production, leading to better standards of living. Hewould have realized the only reason he was born into a rich family in
a rich society was that his ancestors had spent centuries accumulating
capital, deferring gratification and investing in the future. But, like theRomanemperorsduringthedecayoftheempire,hecouldneverunder-stand the work and sacrifice needed to build his affluence and believedinstead that high consumption is the cause of prosperity rather than its
consequence.
Debt is the opposite of saving. If saving creates the possibility of
capital accumulation and civilizational advance, debt is what can reverseit, through the reduction in capital stocks across generations, reduced
productivity, and a decline in living standards. Whether it is housing
debt, Social Security obligations, or government debt that will requireever-higher taxes and debt monetization to refinance, the current gen-erations may be the first in the western world since the demise of theRomanEmpire(or,atleast,theIndustrialRevolution)tocomeintothe
world with less capital than their parents. Rather than witness their sav-
ings accumulate and raise the capital stock, this generation has to workto pay off the growing interest on its debt, working harder to fund enti-tlementprogramstheywillbarelygettoenjoywhilepayinghighertaxesand barely being able to save for their old age.
This move from sound money to depreciating money has led to
several generations of accumulated wealth being squandered on con-spicuousconsumptionwithinagenerationortwo,makingindebtednessthe new method for funding major expenses. Whereas 100 years agomost people would pay for their house, education, or marriage from

Innovations: “Zero to One” versus “One to Many”
The impact of sound money on time preference and future orientation
can be seen in more than just the level of savings, but also in the type
of projects in which a society invests. Under a sound money regime,similar to what the world had in the late nineteenth century, individualsare far more likely to engage in long-term investments and to havelarge amounts of capital available to finance the sort of projects that will
require a long time to pay off. As a result, some of the most important
innovations in human history were born in the golden era at the end ofthe nineteenth century.
In their seminal work, The History of Science and Technology , Bunch
and Hellemans compile a list of the 8,583 most important innovationsand inventions in the history of science and technology. Physicist

which they happened and global population at that year, and measuredthe rate of occurrence of these events per year per capita since the DarkAges.

The wonders of the twentieth century’s improvements make it easy to
forget that the actual inventions—the transformative world-changinginnovations—almost all came in the golden era.

for thought to consider why we do not have many more zero-to-one
transformations under our modern monetary system.
The majority of the technology we use in our modern life was
invented in the nineteenth century, under the gold standard, financedwith the ever-growing stock of capital accumulated by savers storing
their wealth in a sound money and store of value which did not depre-
ciate quickly. A summary of some of the most important innovations ofthe period is provided here:
•Hot and cold running water, indoor toilets, plumbing, central
heating:
These inventions, taken for granted today by anyone living in a
civilized society, are the difference between life and death for mostof us. They have been the main factor in the elimination of mostinfectious diseases across the globe, and allowed for the growth ofurban areas without the ever-present scourge of diseases.
•Electricity, internal combustion engine, mass production:
Our modern industrial society was built around the growth in
utilization of hydrocarbon energy, without which none of the trap-pings of modern civilization would be possible. These foundationaltechnologiesofenergyandindustrywereinventedinthenineteenthcentury.
•Automobile, airplane, city subway, electric elevator:
We have la belle époque to thank for our cities’ streets not being
littered with horse manure, and for our ability to travel around theworld. The automobile was invented by Karl Benz in 1885, the air-planebytheWrightbrothersin1906,thesubwaybyCharlesPearson

•Heart surgery; organ transplant; appendectomy; baby incubator;
radiation therapy; anesthetics, aspirin, blood types and bloodtransfusions, vitamins, electrocardiograph, stethoscope:
Surgery and modern medicine owe their most significant
advances to la belle époque as well. The introduction of modern
sanitation and reliable hydrocarbon energy allowed doctors totransform the way they cared for their patients after centuries oflargely counterproductive measures.

It might be an exaggeration to say that the Internet and all it

It was the tele-graph which fundamentally transformed human society by allowingfor communication without the need for the physical transport ofletters or messengers. That was telecommunication’s zero-to-onemoment, and everything that followed, for all its wonders, has been
a one-to-many improvement.

restricted to scientific and technological advance; they can also be
vividly seen in the art world. It is no coincidence that Florentine andTrim Size: 6in x 9in Ammous c05.tex V1 - 03/05/2018 1:08pm Page 99 k

Venetian artists were the leaders of the Renaissance, as these were the
two cities which led Europe in the adoption of sound money. TheBaroque, Neoclassical, Romantic, Realistic, and post-Impressionistic
schools were all financed by wealthy patrons holding sound money,
with a very low time preference and the patience to wait for years,or even decades, for the completion of masterpieces meant to survivefor centuries. The astonishing domes of Europe’s churches, built anddecorated over decades of inspired meticulous work by incomparable
architectsandartistslikeFilippoBrunelleschiandMichelangelo,wereall
financed with sound money by patrons with very low time preference.The only way to impress these patrons was to build artwork that wouldlast long enough to immortalize their names as the owners of greatcollections and patrons of great artists. This is why Florence’s Medicis
are perhaps better remembered for their patronage of the arts than for
their innovations in banking and finance, though the latter may be farmore consequential.

at length about how his music was better than that of others; he instead
spent his life perfecting his craft. Michelangelo spent four years hanging
from the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel working for most of the day with
little food in order to paint his masterpiece. He even wrote a poem todescribe the ordeal:
18
I’ve grown a goitre by dwelling in this den—
As cats from stagnant streams in Lombardy,
Or in what other land they hap to be—
Which drives the belly close beneath the chin:My beard turns up to heaven; my nape falls in,Fixed on my spine: my breast-bone visibly
Grows like a harp: a rich embroidery
Bedews my face from brush-drops thick and thin.My loins into my paunch like levers grind:My buttock like a crupper bears my weight;
My feet unguided wander to and fro;
In front my skin grows loose and long; behind,By bending it becomes more taut and strait;Crosswise I strain me like a Syrian bow:
Whence false and quaint, I know,
Must be the fruit of squinting brain and eye;For ill can aim the gun that bends awry.Come then, Giovanni, try
To succour my dead pictures and my fame;
Since foul I fare and painting is my shame.
Only with such meticulous and dedicated effort over many decades
did these geniuses succeed in producing these masterpieces, immortal-
izing their names as the masters of their craft. In the era of unsoundmoney, no artist has the low time preference to work as hard or as long

bothered to practice their craft. Only cheap pretentiousness, obscenity,
and shock value attract attention to the naked emperor of modern art,andonlylongpretentiousdiatribesshamingothersfornotunderstandingthe work give it value.
As government money has replaced sound money, patrons with low
time preference and refined tastes have been replaced by government
bureaucrats with political agendas as crude as their artistic taste. Natu-rally, then, neither beauty nor longevity matters anymore, replaced withpolitical prattling and the ability to impress bureaucrats who control the

What is astounding is not just the preponderance of garbage like

tions: turn to the work of dead Austrian economists.
The Use of Knowledge in Society , by Friedrich Hayek, is arguably
one of the most important economic papers to have ever been writ-
ten. Unlike highly theoretical, inconsequential, and esoteric modernacademic research that is read by nobody, the 11 pages of this papercontinue to be read widely 70 years after its publication, and have hada lasting impact on the lives and businesses of many people worldwide,
perhaps none as significant as its role in the founding of one of the most
importantwebsitesontheInternet,andthelargestsinglebodyofknowl-edgeassembledinhumanhistory.JimmyWales,Wikipedia’sfounder,hasstated that the idea for establishing Wikipedia came to him after he readthis paper by Hayek and his explanation of knowledge.
Hayek explained that contrary to popular and elementary treat-
ments of the topic, the economic problem is not merely the problemof allocating resources and products, but more accurately, the prob-lemofallocatingthemusingknowledgethatisnotgiveninitstotalityto
any single individual or entity. Economic knowledge of the conditions
of production, the relative availability and abundance of the factors ofproduction, and the preferences of individuals, is not objective knowl-edge that can be fully known to a single entity. Rather, the knowledgeof economic conditions is by its very nature distributed and situated with
thepeopleconcernedbytheirindividualdecisions.Everyhuman’smind
is consumed in learning and understanding the economic informationrelevant to them. Highly intelligent and hardworking individuals willspend decades learning the economic realities of their industries inorder to reach positions of authority over the production processes of
one single good. It is inconceivable that all these individual decisions
being carried out by everyone could be substituted by aggregating allthat information into one individual’s mind to perform the calculationsfor everyone. Nor is there a need for this insane quest to centralize allknowledge into one decision maker’s hands.
In a free market economic system, prices are knowledge, and the
signals that communicate information. Each individual decision makeris only able to carry out her decisions by examining the prices ofthe goods involved, which carry in them the distillation of all marketconditions and realities into one actionable variable for that individual.Trim Size: 6in x 9in Ammous c06.tex V1 - 03/05/2018 1:09pm Page 107 k

Inturn,eachindividual’sdecisionswillinturnplayaroleinshapingthe
price. No central authority could ever internalize all the informationthat goes into forming a price or replace its function.
To understand Hayek’s point, picture the scenario of an earthquake
badly damaging the infrastructure of a country that is the world’s majorproducer of a commodity, such as the 2010 earthquake in Chile, which
is the world’s largest producer of copper. As the earthquake hit a region
with extensive copper mines, it caused damage to these mines and tothe seaport from which they are exported. This meant a reduction inthesupplyofcoppertotheworldmarketsandimmediatelyresultedina6.2% rise in the price of copper.
1Anybody in the world involved in the
copper market will be affected by this, but they do not need to knowanything about the earthquake, Chile, and the conditions of the marketin orderto decidehow to act. The rise in the price itself contains all therelevant information they need. Immediately, all the firms demanding
copper now have an incentive to demand a smaller quantity of it, delay
purchases that weren’t immediately necessary, and find substitutes. Onthe other hand, the rising price gives all firms that produce copper any-wherearoundtheworldanincentivetoproducemoreofit,tocapitalizeonthepricerise.

As globalmarketshavebecomemoreintegratedandlarger,suchindividualdisrup-tions are becoming less impactful than ever, as market makers have thedepthandliquiditytogetaroundthemquicklywiththeleastdisruption.
To understand the power of prices as a method of communicating
knowledge, imagine that the day before the earthquake, the entirety ofthe global copper industry stopped being a market institution and wasinstead given over to be under the command of a specialized agency,

meaning production is allocated without any recourse to prices. How
would such an agency react to the earthquake? Of all the many copperproducers worldwide, how would they decide which producers shouldincrease their production and by how much?

No matter how much objective data and knowledge the agency
might collect, it can never know all the dispersed knowledge that bearson the decisions that each individual carries out, and that includes theirown preferences and valuations of objects. Prices, then, are not simply
a tool to allow capitalists to profit; they are the information system of

While most understand the importance of the price system to the
division of labor, few get the crucial role it plays in capital accumulation
and allocation, for which we need to turn to the work of Mises. In his1922 book, Socialism, Mises explained the quintessential reason why
socialist systems must fail, and it was notthe commonly held idea that
socialism simply had an incentive problem (Why would anyone work ifeveryone got the same rewards regardless of effort?). Given that lack of
application to one’s job was usually punished with government murder
or imprisonment, socialism arguably overcame the incentive problemsuccessfully, regardless of how bloody the process. After a century
in which around 100 million people worldwide were murdered by
socialist regimes,
2this punishment was clearly not theoretical, and the
incentives to work were probably stronger than in a capitalist system.
There must be more to socialist failure than just incentives, and Mises
was the first to precisely explicate why socialism would fail even if itwere to successfully overcome the incentive problem by creating “the
new socialist man.”
The fatal flaw of socialism that Mises exposed was that without a

In a socialist system, government owns and controls the means of
production,makingitatoncethesolebuyerandsellerofallcapitalgoods
in the economy. That centralization stifles the functioning of an actualmarket, making sound decisions based on prices impossible. Without amarket for capital where independent actors can bid for capital, therecan be no price for capital overall or for individual capital goods. With-
out prices of capital goods reflecting their relative supply and demand,
thereisnorationalwayofdeterminingthemost productiveusesofcap-ital, nor is there a rational way of determining how much to produceof each capital good. In a world in which the government owns thesteel factory, as well as all the factories that will utilize steel in the pro-
duction of various consumer and capital goods, there can be no price
emerging for steel, or for the goods it is used to produce, and hence,no possible way of knowing which uses of steel are the most importantand valuable. How can the government determine whether its limited
quantities of steel should be utilized in making cars or trains, given that
it also owns the car and train factories and allocates by diktat to citizenshowmanycarsandtrainstheycanhave?Withoutapricesystemforciti-zenstodecidebetweentrainsandcars,thereisnowayofknowingwhatthe optimal allocation is and no way of knowing where the steel would

The point of this exposition is not to argue against the socialist
economic system, which no serious adult takes seriously in this dayand age, after the catastrophic, bloody and comprehensive failure it has
achieved in every society in which it has been tried over the last cen-
tury. The point rather is to explicate clearly the difference between twoways of allocating capital and making production decisions: prices andplanning. While most of the world’s countries today do not have a cen-
tral planning board responsible for the direct allocation of capital goods,
it is nonetheless the case in every country in the world that there is acentral planning board for the most important market of all, the marketfor capital. A free market is understood as one in which the buyers and

world has a capital market that has these characteristics today.
Thecapitalmarketsinamoderneconomyconsistofthemarketsfor
loanable funds. As the structure of production becomes more compli-cated and long-term, individuals no longer invest their savings them-
selves, but lend them out, through various institutions, to businesses
specialized in production. The interest rate is the price that the lenderreceives for lending their funds, and the price that the borrower pays toobtain them.
In a free market for loanable funds, the quantity of these funds
supplied, like all supply curves, rises as the interest rate rises. In other
words, the higher the interest rate, the more people are inclined tosave and offer their savings to entrepreneurs and firms. The demandfor loans, on the other hand, is negatively related to the interest rate,
meaning that entrepreneurs and firms will want to borrow less when
the interest rate rises.
The interest rate in a free market for capital is positive because peo-

rate of interest.

Centralbanksdeterminetheinterestrateandthesupplyofloanablefunds
through a variety of monetary tools, operating through their control of
the banking system.6
A fundamental fact to understand about the modern financial
system is that banks create money whenever they engage in lending. Ina fractional reserve banking system similar to the one present all over
the world today, banks not only lend the savings of their customers, but
also their demand deposits. In other words, the depositor can call onthe money at any time while a large percentage of that money has beenissued as a loan to a borrower. By giving the money to the borrower
while keeping it available to the depositor, the bank effectively creates
new money and that results in an increase in the money supply. Thisunderlies the relationship between money supply and interest rates:

Business Cycles and Financial Crises
Whereas in a free market for capital the supply of loanable funds isdetermined by the market participants who decide to lend based on theinterest rate, in an economy with a central bank and fractional reserve
banking, the supply of loanable funds is directed by a committee of
economists under the influence of politicians, bankers, TV pundits, andsometimes, most spectacularly, military generals.
Any passing familiarity with economics will make the dangers of
price controls clear and discernable. Should a government decide to set

ratio,engaginginopenmarketoperations,anddetermininglendingeligibilitycriteria.Adetailedexpla-nation of the mechanism of operation of these tools can be found in any preliminary macroeconomicstextbook. To summarize: the central bank can engage in expansionary monetary policy by (1) reducinginterest rates, which stimulates lending and increases money creation; (2) lowering the required reserveratio, allowing banks to increase their lending, increasing money creation; (3) purchasing treasuries orfinancialassets,whichalsoleadstomoneycreation;and(4)relaxinglendingeligibilitycriteria,allowingbanks to increase lending and thus money creation. Contractionary monetary policy is conducted byreversing these steps, leading to a reduction of the money supply, or at least a reduction in the rate ofgrowth in the money supply.Trim Size: 6in x 9in Ammous c06.tex V1 - 03/05/2018 1:09pm Page 114 k

the price of apples and prevent it from moving, the outcome will be
either a shortage or a surplus and large losses to society overall fromoverproduction or underproduction. In the capital markets, something
similar happens, but the effects are far more devastating as they affect
everysectoroftheeconomy,becausecapitalisinvolvedintheproductionof every economic good.
It is first important to understand the distinction between loanable
funds and actual capital goods. In a free market economy with sound
money,savers havetodeferconsumptioninordertosave.Moneythat is
deposited in a bank as savings is money taken away from consumption
by people who are delaying the gratification that consumption couldgive them in order to gain more gratification in the future. The exactamountofsavingsbecomestheexactamountofloanablefundsavailable
for producers to borrow. The availability of capital goods is inextricably
linkedto the reductionof consumption: actual physical resources,labor,land, and capital goods will move from being employed in the provi-sionoffinalconsumptiongoodstotheproductionofcapitalgoods.The
marginal worker is directed away from car sales and toward a job in the
car factory; the proverbial corn seed will go into the ground instead ofbeing eaten.
Scarcity is the fundamental starting point of all economics, and its
most important implication is the notion that everything has an oppor-
tunity cost. In the capital market, the opportunity cost of capital is for-
goneconsumption,andtheopportunitycostofconsumptionisforgonecapital investment. The interest rate is the price that regulates this rela-tionship: as people demand more investments, the interest rate rises,incentivizing more savers to set aside more of their money for savings.
As the interest rate drops, it incentivizes investors to engage in more
investments, and to invest in more technologically advanced methodsof production with a longer time horizon. A lower interest rate, then,allowsfortheengagementofmethodsofproductionthatarelongerandmore productive: society moves from fishing with rods to fishing with
oil-powered large boats.

producers into engaging in a production process requiring more capital
resources than is actually available. The excess money, backed by no
actual deferred consumption, initially makes more producers borrow,
operating under the delusion that the money will allow them to buy
all the capital goods necessary for their production process. As more
and more producers are bidding for fewer capital goods and resourcesthan they expect there to be, the natural outcome is a rise in the price
of the capital goods during the production process. This is the point at

of several capital investments which suddenly become unprofitable

without the distortions in the capital market and whose completion is
not possible once the misallocations are exposed. The central bank’sintervention in the capital market allows for more projects to be
undertaken because of the distortion of prices that causes investors
to miscalculate, but the central bank’s intervention cannot increase
the amount of actual capital available. So these extra projects are not
completed and become an unnecessary waste of capital. The suspensionof these projects at the same time causes a rise in unemployment across

the inevitable outcome of interest rate manipulation in the same way
shortages are the inevitable outcome of price ceilings.
An analogy can be borrowed from Mises’s work9(and embellished)
to illustrate the point: imagine the capital stock of a society as buildingbricks, and the central bank as a contractor responsible for constructing
them into houses. Each house requires 10,000 bricks to construct, and
the developer is looking for a contractor who will be able to build 100
houses, requiring a total of 1 million. But a Keynesian contractor, eager
to win the contract, realizes his chances of winning the contract willbe enhanced if he can submit a tender promising to build 120 of the
same house while only requiring 800,000 bricks. This is the equivalent
of the interest rate manipulation: it reduces the supply of capital whileincreasing the demand for it. In reality, the 120 houses will require 1.2
million bricks, but there are only 800,000 available. The 800,000 bricks
are sufficient to begin the construction of the 120 houses, but they are
not sufficient to complete them. As the construction begins, the devel-
oper is very happy to see 20% more houses for 80% of the cost, thankstothewondersofKeynesianengineering,whichleadshimtospendthe
20% of the cost he saved on buying himself a new yacht. But the ruse
cannot last as it will eventually become apparent that the houses can-not be completed and the construction must come to a halt. Not only
has the contractor failed to deliver 120 houses, he will have failed to
deliver any houses whatsoever, and instead, he’s left the developer with
120 half-houses, effectively useless piles of bricks with no roofs. The
contractor’s ruse reduced the capital spent by the developer and resultedin the construction of fewer houses than would have been possible with
accurate price signals. The developer would have had 100 houses if he
went with an honest contractor. By going with a Keynesian contractorwho distorts the numbers, the developer continues to waste his capital
for as long as the capital is being allocated on a plan with no basis in
reality. If the contractor realizes the mistake early on, the capital wasted

will only have 120 unfinished homes that are worthless as nobody will
pay to live in a roofless house.
When the central bank manipulates the interest rate lower than the
marketclearingpricebydirectingbankstocreatemoremoneybylend-ing, they are at once reducing the amount of savings available in society
and increasing the quantity demanded by borrowers while also direct-
ing the borrowed capital toward projects which cannot be completed.
Hence, the more unsound the form of money, and the easier it is for
central banks to manipulate interest rates, the more severe the businesscycles are. Monetary history testifies to how much more severe business
cycles and recessions are when the money supply is manipulated than
when it isn’t.
While most people imagine that socialist societies are a thing of
the past and that market systems rule capitalist economies, the real-
ity is that a capitalist system cannot function without a free market in
capital, where the price of capital emerges through the interaction of
supply and demand and the decisions of capitalists are driven by accu-rate price signals. The central bank’s meddling in the capital market is
the root of all recessions and all the crises which most politicians, jour-
nalists, academics, and leftist activists like to blame on capitalism. Only
through the central planning of the money supply can the price mech-
anism of the capital markets be corrupted to cause wide disruptions inthe economy.
Whenever a government has started on the path of inflating the
money supply, there is no escaping the negative consequences. If thecentral bank stops the inflation, interest rates rise, and a recession fol-

capital that took place. If the central bank were to continue its infla-
tionary process indefinitely, it would just increase the scale of misal-locations in the economy, wasting even more capital and making the
inevitable recession even more painful. There is no escape from paying
a hefty bill for the supposed free lunch that Keynesian cranks foistedupon us.

Central bank planning of the money supply is neither desirable nor
possible. It is rule by the most conceited, making the most important
market in an economy under the command of the few people who areignorant enough of the realities of market economies to believe theycan centrally plan a market as large, abstract, and emergent as the cap-
ital market. Imagining that central banks can “prevent,” “combat,” or
“manage” recessions is as fanciful and misguided as placing pyromaniacsand arsonists in charge of the fire brigade.
The relative stability of sound money, for which it is selected by
the market, allows for the operation of a free market through price dis-covery and individual decision making. Unsound money, whose supplyis centrally planned, cannot allow for the emergence of accurate price
signals, because it is by its very nature controlled. Through centuries of
pricecontrols,centralplannershavetriedtofindtheelusivebestpricetoachieve the goals they wanted, to no avail.
11The reason that price con-
trolsmustfailisnotthatthecentralplannerscannotpicktherightprice,
but rather that by merely imposing a price—any price—they prevent
the market process from allowing prices to coordinate consumption andproduction decisions among market participants, resulting in inevitableshortages or surpluses. Equivalently, central planning of credit markets
must fail because it destroys markets’ mechanisms for price-discovery
providing market participants with the accurate signals and incentives tomanage their consumption and production.

and governments could often expand their supply of money and credit
beyond the gold held in their reserves, causing booms and busts similarto those seen in the twentieth century, though to a much lesser degree.
With this background in mind, we can get a far clearer idea of
modern monetary history than what is commonly taught in academictextbooks since the Keynesian deluge. The founding text of Monetaristthought is what is considered the definitive work of U.S. monetary his-tory:The Monetary History of the United States by Milton Friedman and
Anna Schwartz. A giant tome of 888 pages, the book is astounding in
its ability to marshal endless facts, details, statistics, and analytical toolswithout once providing the unfortunate reader with an understandingof one key issue: the causes of financial crises and recessions.
ThefundamentalflawofFriedmanandSchwartz’sbookistypicalof
modern academic scholarship: it is an elaborate exercise in substituting
rigor for logic. The book systematically and methodically avoids everquestioning the causes of the financial crises that have affected the U.S.economy over a century, and instead inundates the reader with impres-
sively researched data, facts, trivia, and minutiae.
The central contention of the book is that recessions are the result
of the government not responding quickly enough to a financial cri-sis, bank run, and deflationary collapse by increasing the money supplyto re-inflate the banking sector. It is typical of the Milton Friedman
bandoflibertarianisminthatitblamesthegovernmentforaneconomic

and May 1920. Only 26% of that increase was due to increases in gold
holdings,meaningthattherestwasdrivenbythegovernment,banks,and
the Federal Reserve. This was the central cause of the 1920 depression,
but this, too, goes unmentioned.
Most curiously, however, is how they completely ignore the recov-
ery from the depression of 1920–21, which was termed the “last natural
recoverytofullemployment”byeconomistBenjaminAnderson,where
taxes and government expenditures were reduced and wages were left
to adjust freely, leading to a swift return to full employment in less
than a year.14The 1920 depression saw one of the fastest contractions

While everyone tries to learn the lesson of the Great Depression,
mainstream economics textbooks never mention the 1920 depression,
and never try to learn why it is that this depression was so quick to
recover.

Only briefly, Friedman and Schwartz mention that the price level
had not risen too quickly during the 1920s, and thus conclude that the
period was not inflationary and so the causes of the depression couldnot have been inflationary. But the 1920s witnessed very fast economicgrowth,whichwouldleadtoadropinprices.Therewasalsoheavymon-etary expansion, caused by the U.S. Federal Reserve attempting to helpthe Bank of England stem the flow of gold from its shores, which wasin turn caused by the Bank of England inflating instead of letting wagesadjust downward.

supply had not translated to a rise in consumer good prices because it
had mainly been directed by the Federal Reserve to stimulate the stock
and housing markets. The money supply expanded by 68.1% over the
period of 1921–29 while the gold stock only expanded by 15%.16It is
this increase of the dollar stock, beyond the stock of gold, which is the
root cause of the Great Depression.
An honorable mention has to go to the father of the Monetarists,
Irving Fisher, who spent the 1920s engaged in the “scientific manage-
ment of the price level”. Fisher had imagined that as the United States

it would not be until the mid-1950s, years after Fisher died, that the
stock market would get back to the “permanently high plateau” Fisher

would later proclaim Irving Fisher as the greatest economist America
had produced.

problem of having a system of fractional reserve banking—it’s a disas-

the Fed to guarantee people’s deposits—though not guarantee the losses
of businesses and the stock market. Leaving the banks alone to suffer
from this, allowing the liquidation to take place and prices to fall, is the
only solution. It is true that this solution would have involved a painful

The monetary expansion created illusory wealth that misallocated
resources, and that wealth must disappear for the market to go back to
functioningproperlywithaproperpricemechanism.Itwasthisillusorywealth that caused the collapse in the first place. Returning that illusorywealth to its original location is simply reassembling the house of cardsagain and preparing it for another, bigger and stronger fall.
Having summarily dismissed the era leading up to 1929 as having
anything to do with the stock market crash, Friedman and Schwartzthen conclude that it was merely the Fed’s reaction to the crash whichcaused it to turn into a Great Depression. Had the Federal Reserveopened the monetary spigots to drench the banking system with liq-
uidity, they argue, then the stock market losses would have been largely
inconsequential to the wider economy and there would not have beena larger depression. The fact that the Fed was in fact expansionary inresponse to this crisis is ignored in the deluge of data. While the Federal
Reserve did attempt to alleviate the liquidity shortages in the bank-
ing sector, it could not stem the collapse, not because of a shortage ofresolve, but rather due to the economy-wide collapse of misallocatedcapital investments, and the heavily interventionist policies discussed inChapter 4.

Sound Basis for Trade
In the world of sound money, goods and capital flowed between dif-ferent countries almost in the same way they flowed between differentregions of the same country: according to the desires of their rightful
owners as agreed upon in mutually beneficial exchange. Under Julius
Caesar’s aureus, or under the gold standard of the Bank of Amsterdam
in the seventeenth century, or under the nineteenth century gold stan-
dard, physically moving a good from one location to the other wasthe most significant barrier to trade. Tariffs and trade barriers hardly
existed, and if they did, they constituted little more than fees to pay
for the management and maintenance of border crossing points and
seaports.

In the era of unsound money, such as in Europe’s descent into
feudalism or in the modern world’s descent into monetary nationalism,trade stops being the prerogative of the transacting individuals and starts
becoming a matter of national importance, requiring the oversight
of the feudal lords or governments claiming sovereignty over thetrading individuals. So ridiculously complete has this transformationof the nature of trade been that, in the twentieth century, the termfree tradecame to refer to trade carried out between two individuals
across borders, according to terms agreed upon by their respective
governments, not by the concerned individuals!
The abandonment of the gold standard in 1914 through the
suspension and limitation of exchanging paper money for gold by mostgovernments began the period Hayek named Monetary Nationalism.
Money’s value stopped being a fixed unit of gold, which was the
commodity with the highest stock-to-flow ratio, and hence the lowestprice elasticity of supply, keeping its value predictable and relativelyconstant. Instead, the value of money oscillated along with the vagaries
of monetary and fiscal policy as well as international trade. Lower
interestratesorincreasedmoneysupplywoulddropthevalueofmoney,as would government spending financed by central bank lending tothe government. While these two factors were nominally under thecontrol of governments, who could at least delude themselves into
thinking they could manage them to achieve stability, the third factor
was a complex emergent outcome of the actions of all citizens andmany foreigners. When a country’s exports grew larger than its imports(a trade surplus), its currency would appreciate on the internationalexchange markets, whereas it would depreciate when its imports grew
larger than exports (trade deficit). Policymakers, instead of taking
this as a sign to stop tinkering with the value of money and allowpeople the freedom to use the least volatile commodity as money,took it as an invitation to micromanage the smallest details of globaltrade.

One can only imagine the sort of confusion that would happentoallengineeringprojectswerethelengthofthemetertooscillatedailywith the pronouncements of a central measurements office.
Only the vanity of the insane can be affected by changing the
unit with which they’re measured. Making the meter shorter mightmake someone whose house’s area is 200 square meters believe it isactually 400 square meters, but it would still be the same house. Allthat this redefinition of the meter has caused is ruin an engineer’sability to properly build or maintain a house. Similarly, devaluing acurrency may make a country richer nominally, or increase the nominalvalue of its exports, but it does nothing to make the country moreprosperous.
Modern economics has formulated “The Impossible Trinity”
to express the plight of modern central bankers, which states: No
government can successfully achieve all three goals of having a fixedforeign exchange rate, free capital flows, and an independent monetarypolicy. Should a government have a fixed exchange rate and freecapital flows, it cannot have its own monetary policy, as altering theinterest rate will cause capital to flow in or out to the point wherethe exchange rate becomes indefensible, and we all know how muchmodern economists appreciate having a monetary policy to “manage”the economy. Having an independent monetary policy and a fixedexchange rate can only be achieved by limiting capital flows, whichwas the situation prevalent in the period between 1946 and 1971. Buteven that was not sustainable as the flow of goods became the way inwhich exchange rates would try to redress the imbalance, with somecountries exporting too much and others importing too much, leadingto political negotiations to recalibrate the exchange rate. There can beno rational ground for determining the outcome of these negotiationsin international organizations, as each country’s government attemptsto pursue its own special groups’ interest and will do whatever it takesto do just that. After 1971, the world predominantly moved to havingan independent monetary policy and free capital flows, but floatingexchange rates between currencies.Trim Size: 6in x 9in Ammous c06.tex V1 - 03/05/2018 1:09pm Page 129 k

This arrangement has the advantage of allowing Keynesian
economists to play with their favorite tools for “managing” economies
while also keeping international financial institutions and large capital
owners happy. It is also a huge boon for large financial institutionswhich have generated a foreign exchange market worth trillions of
dollarsad a y, where currencies and their futures are trading. But
this arrangement is likely not to the benefit of almost everyone else,particularly for people who actually have productive enterprises that
offer valuable goods to society.
In a highly globalized world where foreign exchange rates are
dependent upon a plethora of domestic and international variables,running a productive business becomes challenging completely unnec-
essarily. A successful firm likely has inputs and outputs from its business
come and go to multiple countries. Every single purchase and saledecision is dependent on the foreign exchange between the countries
involved. In this world, a highly competitive firm could suffer high
losses through nothing more than a shift in exchange rates, not evennecessarily involving its own country. If the firm’s major supplier’s
country witnesses a rise in the value of its currency, the firm’s input
costs could rise enough to destroy the firm’s profitability. The samething could happen if the currency of the main market to which it
exports drops in value. Firms that have spent decades working on
a competitive advantage could see it wiped out in 15 minutes ofunpredictable foreign exchange volatility. This usually gets blamed on
free trade, and economists and politicians likewise will use it as an
excuse for implementing popular but destructive protectionist tradepolicies.

ThecombinationoffloatingexchangeratesandKeynesianideology
has given our world the entirely modern phenomenon of currency
wars: because Keynesian analysis says that increasing exports leads to an
increase in GDP, and GDP is the holy grail of economic well-being,it thus follows, in the mind of Keynesians, that anything that boostsexports is good. Because a devalued currency makes exports cheaper,
any country facing an economic slowdown can boost its GDP and
employment by devaluing its currency and increasing its exports.
There are many things wrong with this worldview. Reducing the
value of the currency does nothing to increase the competitiveness of
the industries in real terms. Instead, it only creates a one-time discount
on their outputs, thus offering them to foreigners at a lower price thanTrim Size: 6in x 9in Ammous c06.tex V1 - 03/05/2018 1:09pm Page 132 k

purchase land, capital, and resources in the country at a discount. In a
liberal economic order, there is nothing wrong with foreigners buyinglocal assets, but in a Keynesian economic order, foreigners are activelysubsidized to come buy the country at a discount. Further, economic
history shows that the most successful economies of the postwar era,
suchasGermany,Japan,andSwitzerland,grewtheirexportssignificantlyas their currency continued to appreciate. They did not need constantdevaluation to make their exports grow; they developed a competitive
advantage that made their products demanded globally, which in turn
caused their currencies to appreciate compared to their trade partners,increasingthewealthoftheirpopulation.Itiscounterproductiveforthecountries importing from them to think they can boost their exports by

But even if all of these problems with devaluation as the route to

cies would devalue and no single country would have an advantage over
the others. This brings us to the current state of affairs in the globaleconomy, where most governments attempt to devalue their currenciesin order to boost their exports, and all complain about one another’s

There are today two main government-approved mainstream
schools of economic thought: Keynesians and Monetarists. While
these two schools have widely disparate methodologies and analyticalframeworks, and while they are engaged in bitter academic fightsaccusing each other of not caring about the poor, the children, theenvironment, inequality, or the buzzword du jour, they both agree
on two unquestionable truths: first, the government has to expandthe money supply. Second, both schools deserve more governmentfunding to continue researching really important Big Questions whichwill lead them to find ever-more-creative ways of arriving at the firsttruth.
It’s important to understand the different rationales for the two
schools of thought in order to understand how they can both arriveat the same conclusion and be equally wrong. Keynes was a failedinvestor and statistician who never studied economics but was sowell-connected with the ruling class in Britain that the embarrassingdrivel he wrote in his most famous book, The General Theory of
Employment, Money, and Interest , was immediately elevated into the
status of founding truths of macroeconomics. His theory begins withthe (completely unfounded and unwarranted) assumption that the mostimportantmetricindeterminingthestateoftheeconomyisthelevelof

aggregate spending across society. When society collectively spends a
lot, the spending incentivizes producers to create more products, thusemploying more workers and reaching full-employment equilibrium.If spending rises too much, beyond the capacity of producers to keepup, it would lead to inflation and a rise in the overall price level. Onthe other hand, when society spends too little, producers reduce their
production, firing workers and increasing unemployment, resulting in a
recession.
Recessions, for Keynes, are caused by abrupt reductions in the
aggregate level of spending. Keynes was not very good with graspingthe concept of causality and logical explanations, so he never quitebothered to explain whyit is that spending levels might suddenly
drop, instead just coining another of his famous clumsy and utterlymeaningless figures of speech to save him the hassle of an explanation.He blamed it on the flagging of “animal spirits.” To this day, nobody
knows exactly what these animal spirits are or why they might suddenly
flag, but that of course has only meant that an entire cottage industryof state-funded economists have made a career out of attempting toexplain them or finding real-world data that can correlate to them. Thisresearch has been very good for academic careers, but is of no value toanyone actually trying to understand business cycles. Put bluntly, poppsychology is no substitute for capital theory.

Keynes can then happily recommend the solution he is selling. When-
ever there is a recession, or a rise in the unemployment level, the cause
is a drop in the aggregate level of spending and the solution is for thegovernment to stimulate spending, which will in turn increase produc-tion and reduce unemployment. There are three ways of stimulatingaggregate spending: increasing the money supply, increasing govern-ment spending, or reducing taxes. Reducing taxes is generally frownedupon by Keynesians. It is viewed as the least effective method, becausepeople will not spend all the taxes they don’t have to pay—some ofthat money will be saved, and Keynes absolutely detested saving. Sav-ing would reduce spending, and reducing spending would be the worst

The other main school of government-approved economic thought
in our day and age is the Monetarist school, whose intellectual father is
Milton Friedman. Monetarists are best understood as the battered wivesoftheKeynesians:theyaretheretoprovideaweak,watered-downstraw-manversionofafreemarketargumenttocreatetheillusionofaclimateofintellectualdebate,andtobeconstantlyandcomprehensivelyrebutted

The sum total of the contribution of both these schools of thought
istheconsensustaughtinundergraduatemacroeconomicscoursesacrossthe world: that the central bank should be in the business of expandingthe money supply at a controlled pace, to encourage people to spendmore and thus keep the unemployment level sufficiently low. Should a
central bank contract the money supply, or fail to expand it adequately,
thenadeflationaryspiralcantakeplace,whichwoulddiscouragepeoplefrom spending their money and thus harm employment and cause aneconomic downturn.
6Such is the nature of this debate that most main-
stream economists and textbooks do not even consider the question of
whether the money supply should be increased at all, assuming that itsincreaseis agivenand discussing how centralbanksneedtomanage thisincrease and dictate its rates. The creed of Keynes, which is universallypopulartoday,isthecreedofconsumptionandspendingtosatisfyimme-
diate wants. By constantly expanding the money supply, central banks’
monetary policy makes saving and investment less attractive and thus itencourages people to save and invest less while consuming more. Thereal impact of this is the widespread culture of conspicuous consump-tion, where people live their lives to buy ever-larger quantities of crap

of scholarship from around the world. Commonly referred to today as
the Austrian school, in honor of the last great generation of economists
from Austria in its golden age pre-World War I, this school draws on
the work of Classical Scottish, French, Spanish, Arab, and Ancient
Greekeconomistsinexplicatingitsunderstandingofeconomics.Unlike
Keynesian and Monetarist fixation on rigorous numerical analysis andmathematicalsophistry,theAustrianschoolisfocusedonestablishingan
understanding of phenomena in a causal manner and logically deducing
implications from demonstrably true axioms.
The Austrian theory of money posits that money emerges in a mar-
ket as the most marketable commodity and most salable asset, the oneassetwhoseholderscansellwiththemostease,infavorableconditions.
7
An asset that holds its value is preferable to an asset that loses value,and savers who want to choose a medium of exchange will gravitatetoward assets that hold value over time as monetary assets. Network
effects mean that eventually only one, or a few, assets can emerge as
media of exchange. For Mises, the absence of control by government
is a necessary condition for the soundness of money, seeing as govern-
ment will have the temptation to debase its money whenever it beginsto accrue wealth as savers invest in it.
By placing a hard cap on the total supply of bitcoins, as discussed in
Chapter 8, Nakamoto was clearly unpersuaded by the arguments of the
standard macroeconomics textbook and more influenced by the Aus-
trian school, which argues that the quantity of money itself is irrelevant,that any supply of money is sufficient to run an economy of any size,
because the currency units are infinitely divisible, and because it is only
the purchasing power of money in terms of real goods and services that
matters, and not its numerical quantity. As Ludwig von Mises put it:
8
The services money renders are conditioned by the height of its pur-
chasing power. Nobody wants to have in his cash holding a definitenumberofpiecesofmoneyoradefiniteweightofmoney;hewantstokeep a cash holding of a definite amount of purchasing power.

for money coincide, there can never be an excess or a deficiency of
money. Each individual and all individuals together always enjoy fully
the advantages which they can derive from indirect exchange and the
useofmoney,nomatterwhetherthetotalquantityofmoneyisgreatorsmall ... the services which money renders can be neither improvednor impaired by changing the supply of money ....Thequantityof
money available in the whole economy is always sufficient to securefor everybody all that money does and can do.
Murray Rothbard concurs with Mises:9
A world of constant money supply would be one similar to that ofmuch of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, marked by the suc-cessful flowering of the Industrial Revolution with increased capitalinvestment increasing the supply of goods and with falling prices forthose goods as well as falling costs of production.
According to the Austrian view, if the money supply is fixed, then
economic growth will cause prices of real goods and services to drop,
allowing people to purchase increasing quantities of goods and services
with their money in the future. Such a world would indeed discourage
immediate consumption as the Keynesians fear, but encourage saving
and investment for the future where more consumption can happen.Foraschoolofthoughtsteepedinhightimepreference,itisunderstand-
able that Keynes could not understand that increased savings’ impact on
consumption in any present moment is more than outweighed by the
increases in spending caused by the increased savings of the past. A soci-
ety which constantly defers consumption will actually end up being a
society that consumes more in the long run than a low savings society,
sincethelow-time-preferencesocietyinvestsmore,thusproducingmore
income for its members. Even with a larger percentage of their income
going to savings, the low-time-preference societies will end up having
higher levels of consumption in the long run as well as a larger capital
stock.

would punish the girl by giving her half a marshmallow instead of
two, making the entire concept of self-control and low time preferenceappear counterproductive. Indulging immediate pleasures is the more
likely course of action economically, and that will then reflect on
culture and society at large. The Austrian school, on the other hand,by preaching sound money, recognizes the reality of the trade-off thatnature provides humans, and that if the child waits, there will be morereward for her, making her happier in the long run, encouraging her to
defer her gratification to increase it.
When the value of money appreciates, people are likely to be far
more discerning with their consumption and to save far more of theirincome for the future. The culture of conspicuous consumption, ofshoppingastherapy,ofalwaysneedingtoreplacecheapplasticcrapwith

money which appreciates in value over time. Such a world would causepeople to develop a lower time preference, as their monetary decisionswill orient their actions toward the future, teaching them to value the
future more and more. We can thus see how such a society would cause
peoplenotonlytosaveandinvestmore,butalsotobemorally,artistically,and culturally oriented toward the long-term future.
A currency that appreciates in value incentivizes saving, as savings
gain purchasing power over time. Hence, it encourages deferred con-
sumption, resulting in lower time preference. A currency that depreci-
ates in value, on the other hand, leaves citizens constantly searching forreturnstobeatinflation,returnsthatmustcomewitharisk,andsoleadstoan increasein investment inrisky projectsand an increasedrisk toler-ance among investors, leading to increased losses. Societies with money
of stable value generally develop a low time preference, learning to save
and think of the future, while societies with high inflation and depreci-ating economies will develop high time preference as people lose trackof the importance of saving and concentrate on immediate enjoyment.
Further, an economy with an appreciating currency would witness

This exposition helps explain why Austrian school economists are
morefavorabletotheuseofgoldasmoneywhileKeynesianmainstream
economists support the government’s issuance of elastic money that can
be expanded at the government’s behest. For Keynesians, the fact that
the whole world’s central banks run on fiat currencies is testament tothe superiority of their ideas. For Austrians, on the other hand, the fact
that governments have to resort to coercive measures of banning gold as
money and enforcing payment in fiat currencies is at once testament to

reasons that drive the relationship between unsound money and war.
First, unsound money is itself a barrier to trade between countries,because it distorts value between the countries and makes trade flows
a political issue, creating animosity and enmity between governments
and populations. Second, government having access to a printing pressallows it to continue fighting until it completely destroys the value of itscurrency, and not just until it runs out of money. With sound money,the government’s war effort was limited by the taxes it could collect.
With unsound money, it is restrained by how much money it can create
before the currency is destroyed, making it able to appropriate wealthfar more easily. Third, individuals dealing with sound money developa lower time preference, allowing them to think more of cooperationrather than conflict, as discussed in Chapter 5.

French historian Élie Halévy defined the Era of Tyrannies as having
begun in 1914 with World War I, when the major powers of the worldshifted toward economic and intellectual nationalization. They nation-alized the means of production and shifted to syndicalist and corporatistmodes of societal organization, all while suppressing ideas viewed asopposed to the national interest, as well as the promotion of nationalismin what he termed “the organization of enthusiasm.”

This classical liberal conception of government is only possible in a
world with sound money, which acted as a natural restraint against gov-
ernment authoritarianism and overreach. As long as government had to
tax its people to finance its operations, it had to restrict its operations towhatitssubjectsdeemedtolerable.Governmentshadtokeepabalancedbudget by always keeping consumption within the limits of earningsfrom taxation. In a society of sound money, government is reliant onthe consent of its population to finance its operations.

Unsound money, on the other hand, allows governments to buy
allegiance and popularity by spending on achieving popular objectiveswithout having to present the bill to their people. Government
simply increases the money supply to finance any harebrained scheme
it concocts, and the true cost of such schemes is only felt by thepopulation in years to come when the inflation of the money supplycauses prices to rise, at which point the destruction of the value ofthe currency can be easily blamed on myriad factors, usually involving
some nefarious plots by foreigners, bankers, local ethnic minorities,
or previous or future governments. Unsound money is a particularlydangerous tool in the hands of modern democratic governmentsfacing constant reelection pressure. Modern voters are unlikely tofavor the candidates who are upfront about the costs and benefits
of their schemes; they are far more likely to go with the scoundrels
who promise a free lunch and blame the bill on their predecessors orsome nefarious conspiracy. Democracy thus becomes a mass delusionof people attempting to override the rules of economics by voting
themselves a free lunch and being manipulated into violent tantrums
against scapegoats whenever the bill for the free lunch arrives viainflation and economic recessions.
Unsound money is at the heart of the modern delusion believed by
most voters and those unfortunate enough to study modern macroeco-

History is repletewith examples of how governments that have the prerogative to createmoneyoutofthinairhavealmostalwaysabusedthisprivilegebyturning
it against their own people.
It is no coincidence that when recounting the most horrific tyrants
of history, one finds that every single one of them operated a systemof government-issued money which was constantly inflated to financegovernmentoperation.ThereisaverygoodreasonthatVladimirLenin,JosephStalin,MaoZeDong,AdolfHitler,MaximilienRobespierre,PolPot,BenitoMussolini,KimJongIl,andmanyothernotoriouscriminalsall ruled in periods of unsound government-issued money which theycould print at will to finance their genocidal and totalitarian megalo-

But oncesound money was destroyed, it became very easy for these criminals totake over power and take command of all of their society’s resources byincreasing the supply of unsound money.

Unsound money makes government power potentially unlimited,
withlargeconsequencestoeveryindividual,forcingpoliticstothecenterstage of their life and redirecting much of society’s energy and resourcesto the zero-sum game of who gets to rule and how. Sound money, onthe other hand, makes the form of government a question with limitedconsequences. A democracy, republic, or monarchy are all restrained bysound money, allowing most individuals a large degree of freedom intheir personal life.
Whether in the Soviet or capitalist economies, the notion of the
government “running” or “managing” the economy to achieve eco-nomic goals is viewed as good and necessary. It is worth returning hereto the views of John Maynard Keynes to understand the motivationsof the economic system he proposes, with which humanity has had tocontend for the past decades. In one of his lesser-known papers, The
End of Laissez-Faire , Keynes offers his conception of what the role of
government in a society should be. Keynes expresses his opposition ofliberalism and individualism, which one would expect, but also presentsthe grounds of his opposition to socialism, stating:
Nineteenth-century State Socialism sprang from Bentham, free
competition, etc., and is in some respects a clearer, in some respectsa more muddled, version of just the same philosophy as underliesnineteenth-century individualism. Both equally laid all their stress onfreedom, the one negatively to avoid limitations on existing freedom,the other positively to destroy natural or acquired monopolies. Theyare different reactions to the same intellectual atmosphere.
Keynes’s problem with socialism, then, is that its end goal was
increasing individual freedom. For Keynes, the end goal should notbe concerned with trivial issues like individual freedom, but forgovernmenttocontrolaspectsoftheeconomytohisliking.Heoutlinesthree main arenas where he views government’s role to be vital: first,“the deliberate control of the currency and of credit by a centralinstitution,” the belief that laid the groundwork for modern centralbanking. Second, and relatedly, Keynes believed it was the role of thegovernment to decide on “the scale on which it is desirable that thecommunity as a whole should save, the scale on which these savingsshould go abroad in the form of foreign investments, and whetherTrim Size: 6in x 9in Ammous c07.tex V1 - 03/05/2018 1:09pm Page 154 k

k154 THE BITCOIN STANDARD
the present organization of the investment market distributes savings
along the most nationally productive channels. I do not think that these
matters should be left entirely to the chances of private judgement and
private profits, as they are at present.” And finally, Keynes believed itwas the role of the government to devise “a considered national policyabout what size of population, whether larger or smaller than at present
or the same, is most expedient. And having settled this policy, we must
take steps to carry it into operation. The time may arrive a little laterwhen the community as a whole must pay attention to the innatequality as well as to the mere numbers of its future members.”
17
In other words, the Keynesian conception of the state, from which
came the modern central banking doctrines held widely by all centralbankers,andwhichshapethevastmajorityofeconomictextbookswrit-ten worldwide, comes from a place of a man who wanted government
directionoftwoimportantareasoflife:first,thecontrolofmoney,credit,
saving, and investment decisions, which meant the totalitarian central-izationofcapitalallocationanddestructionoffreeindividualenterprise,makingindividualsutterlydependentongovernmentfortheirbasicsur-
vival, and second, the control of population quantity and quality, which
meant eugenics. And unlike socialists, Keynes did not seek this level ofcontrol over individuals in order to enhance their freedom in the longrun,butrathertodevelopagrandervisionofsocietyasheseesfit.While
socialistsmayhavehadthedecencytoatleastpretendtowanttoenslave
man for his own good, to free him in the future, Keynes wanted gov-ernment enslavement for its own sake, as the ultimate end. This mayhelpexplainwhyMurrayRothbardsaid,“Thereisonlyonegoodthing
about Marx, at least he was not a Keynesian.”
18
While such a conception might appeal to ivory-tower idealists who
imagine it will only lead to positive outcomes, in reality this leads tothe destruction of the market mechanisms necessary for economic pro-
duction to take place. In such a system, money stops functioning as an
information system for production, but rather as a government loyaltyprogram.

unprofitable business, thus forcing more and more of the world’s capital
and labor to be directed toward the production of nonmonetary goods.
For John Maynard Keynes and Milton Friedman, one of the
main attractions of moving away from the gold standard was the
reduction in the costs of goldmining that would ensue from switching
to government-issued paper money, whose cost of production is farlowerthanthatofgold.Theynotonlymisunderstoodthatgoldhasvery
few resources going to its production compared to other goods whose
supply can be inflated far more easily, they also severely underestimatedthe real costs to society from a form of money whose supply can be
expanded at the will of a government susceptible to democratic and
special-interest politics. The real cost is not in the direct cost of runningthe printing presses, but from all the economic activity forgone as
productive resources chase after the new government-issued money
rather than engage in economic production.
Inflationary credit creation can be understood as a society-wide

bezzle” in his book on the Great Depression. As credit expansion in
the 1920s soared, corporations were awash with money, and it was veryeasy for people to embezzle that money in various ways. For as long
as the credit keeps flowing, the victims are oblivious, and an illusion
of increased wealth is created across society as both the victim and therobber think they have the money. Credit creation by central bankscauses unsustainable booms by allowing the financing of unprofitableprojects and allowing them to continue consuming resources on
unproductive activities.
In a sound monetary system, any business that survives does so by
offering value to society, by receiving a higher revenue for its prod-ucts than the costs it incurs for its inputs. The business is productivebecause it transforms inputs of a certain market price into outputs with
ahighermarketprice.Anyfirmthatproducesoutputsvaluedatlessthan
its inputs would go out of business, its resources freed up to be used byother, more productive firms, in what economist Joseph Schumpetertermedcreativedestruction . There can be no profit in a free market with-
out the real risk of loss, and everyone is forced to have skin in the game:
failure is always a real possibility, and can be costly. Government-issuedunsound money, however, can stall this process, keeping unproductivefirmsundeadbutnottrulyalive,theeconomicequivalentofzombiesorvampires drawing on the resources of the alive and productive firms to

It creates a new societal caste that exists according to rules differentfrom those of everyone else, with no skin in the game. Facing no mar-ket test for their work, they are insulated from consequences to theiractions. This new caste exists in every economic sector supported by
government money.
It is not possible to estimate with any degree of accuracy what per-
centage of the economic activity in the modern world economy goestowardpursuinggovernment-printedmoneyratherthantheproductionof goods and services useful to society, but it is possible to get an idea by
looking at which firms and sectors survive because of succeeding in the

prime example, and the global notoriety they have earned for theiremployees’ incompetence can only be understood as a function of thebezzle funding that finances them being completely detached fromeconomic reality. Instead of the hard test of market success by servingcitizens, government agencies test themselves and invariably conclude
the answer to all their failings lies in more funding. No matter the
level of incompetence, negligence, or failure, government agencies andemployees rarely ever face real consequences.

Onlythe successful bankers and banks stay in their job, as those that fail areweededout.Inasocietyofsoundmoney,therearenoliquidityconcernsover the failure of a bank, as all banks hold all their deposits on hand,
and have investments of matched maturity. In other words, there is no
distinction between illiquidity and insolvency, and there is no systemicrisk that could make any bank “too big to fail.” A bank that fails is theproblem of its shareholders and lenders, and nobody else.
Unsound money allows the possibility of mismatching maturity, of
which fractional reserve banking is but a subset, and this leaves banksalways liable to a liquidity crisis, or a bank run. Maturity mismatching,or fractional reserve banking as a special case of it, is always liable to aliquidity crisis if lenders and depositors were to demand their deposits
at the same time. The only way to make maturity mismatching safe is
withthepresenceofalenderoflastresortstandingreadytolendtobanksin case of a bank run.
26In a society with sound money, a central bank
would have to tax everyone not involved in the bank in order to bailout the bank. In a society with unsound money, the central bank issimply able to create new money supply and use it to support the bank’sliquidity. Unsound money thus creates a distinction between liquidityand solvency: a bank could be solvent in terms of the net present valueof its assets but face a liquidity problem that prevents it from meeting
its financial obligations within a certain period of time. But the lack of
liquidity itself could trigger a bank run as depositors and lenders seekto get their deposits out of the bank. Worse, the lack of liquidity inone bank could lead to a lack of liquidity in other banks dealing withthis bank, creating systemic risk problems. If the central bank crediblycommits to providing liquidity in such cases, however, there will be nofear of a liquidity crisis, which in turn averts the scenario of a bank runand leaves the banking system safe.
Fractional reserve banking, or maturity mismatching more gener-
ally, is likely to continue to cause financial crises without a central bank

using an elastic money supply to bail out these banks. But the presence
of a central bank able to bail out the banks creates a major problem ofmoral hazard for these banks. They can now take excessive risks know-ing that the central bank will be inclined to bail them out to avert asystemic crisis. From this we see how banking has evolved into a busi-ness that generates returns without risks to bankers and simultaneously
creates risks without returns for everyone else.

percentage of university students who are interested in pursuingcareers in finance, rather than in engineering, medicine, or other more
productive industries.
Astelecommunicationshaveadvanced,onewouldexpectthatmore
and more of the financial industry’s work can be automated and donemechanistically, leading to the industry shrinking in size over time. Butin reality it continues to mushroom, not because of any fundamental
demand, but because it is protected from losses by government and
allowed to thrive.
The bezzle may be most pronounced in the financial industry, but
it does not stop at the banking industry. It arguably constitutes a long-standing competitive advantage for firms of larger size over those of a
smaller size. In a society in which capital investments are financed from
savings,capitalisownedbythosewithalowertimepreference,andtheyallocateitbasedontheirownestimationofthelikelihoodsofmarketsuc-cess,receivingrewardsforbeingcorrectandlossesforbeingwrong.But
with unsound money, savings are destroyed and capital is instead created
from inflationary bank credit, and its allocation is decided by the cen-tral bank and its member banks. Instead of the allocation being decidedby the most prudent members of society with the lowest time prefer-ence and best market foresight, it is decided by government bureaucrats
whose incentive is to lend as much as possible, not be correct, as they
are significantly protected from the downside.
Centrally planning credit allocation is no different from any kind
of central planning. It results in bureaucrats checking boxes and fillingin paperwork to ensure they meet their bosses’ requirements while the
ostensible purpose of the work is lost. The insight of the banker and the
diligence of examining the real value of investments is replaced withthe box-ticking of meeting central bank lending requirements. A majoradvantage in securing centralized credit is scale, as it appears quantita-tively less risky to lend to large-scale lenders. The larger the firm, the
more predictable the formula for its success, the larger the collateral in
case it fails, and the more secure bank bureaucrats feel when makingloans according to central bank lending criteria. While many industriescould benefit from economies of scale, centralized credit issuanceaccentuates the advantages of size above and beyond what would be theTrim Size: 6in x 9in Ammous c07.tex V1 - 03/05/2018 1:09pm Page 164 k

it knows what to do with is a good candidate, seeing as such a scenario

In a world in which almost all firms are financed through cen-

bosses can only really afford to be assholes in the economic fake reality

of Coase’s Law, described by Coase in his essay: “The Nature of the Firm,” Economica ,v o l .4 ,n o .1 6
(1937): 386–405. According to Coase, the reason firms exist is that the individual contracting of taskscan be more expensive because it involves transaction costs, such as search and information, bargaining,contracting, and enforcement costs. A firm will thus grow for as long as it can benefit from doingactivities in-house to overcome higher external contracting costs.

Digital Money
The global telecommunication revolution, starting with the
production of the first fully programmable computer in the1950s, has encroached on an increasing number of material
aspects of life, providing engineering solutions to hitherto age-oldproblems. While banks and startup firms increasingly utilized computerand network technology for payments and recordkeeping, the innova-tions that succeeded did not provide a new form of money, and theinnovationsthattriedtoprovideanewformofmoneyallfailed.Bitcoinrepresents the first truly digital solution to the problem of money, andinitwefindapotentialsolutiontotheproblemsofsalability,soundness,and sovereignty.

and government paper—may appear quaint anachronisms in our
modern world—abacuses next to our modern computers.
We saw how the introduction of metallurgy produced solutions to
the problem of money that were superior to beads, shellfish, and otherartifacts, and how the emergence of regular coinage allowed gold and
silver coins to emerge as superior forms of money to irregular lumps of
metal. We further saw how gold-backed banking allowed gold to dom-inate as the global monetary standard and led to the demonetization ofsilver. From the necessity of centralizing gold arose government moneybacked by gold, which was more salable in scale, but with it came gov-ernment expansion of the money supply and coercive control whicheventually destroyed money’s soundness and sovereignty. Every step ofthe way, technological advances and realities shaped the monetary stan-dards that people employed, and the consequences to economies and
society were enormous. Societies and individuals who chose a sound
monetary standard, such as the Romans under Caesar, the Byzantinesunder Constantine, or Europeans under the gold standard, benefitedimmensely. Those who had unsound or technologically inferior money,such as Yap Islanders with the arrival of O’Keefe, West Africans usingglassbeads,ortheChineseonasilverstandardinthenineteenthcentury,paid a heavy price.
Bitcoin represents a new technological solution to the money prob-
lem, born out of the digital age, utilizing several technological inno-vations that were developed over the past few decades and building on
many attempts at producing digital money to deliver something which

Bitcoin as Digital Cash
To understand the significance of a technology for digital cash, it isinstructive to look at the world before Bitcoin was invented, when oneTrim Size: 6in x 9in Ammous c08.tex V1 - 03/05/2018 1:09pm Page 169 k

couldneatlydividepaymentmethodsintotwodistinctnon-overlapping
categories:
1.Cash payments, which are carried out in person between two par-
ties. These payments have the convenience of being immediate andfinal, and require no trust on the part of either transacting party.
There is no delay in the execution of the payment, and no third
party can effectively intervene to stop such payments. Their maindrawback is the need for the two parties to be physically present inthe same place at the same time, a problem which becomes moreand more pronounced as telecommunication makes it more likelyfor individuals to want to transact with persons who are not in their
immediate vicinity.
2.Intermediated payments, which require a trusted third party, and
comprise cheques, credit cards, debit cards, bank wire transfers,money transfer services, and more recent innovations such asPayPal. By definition, intermediated payment involves a third party
handling the money transfer between the two transacting parties.
The main advantages of intermediated payments are allowingpayments without the two parties having to be at the same place atthe same time, and allowing the payer to make payment withouthaving to carry her money on her. Their main drawback is the
trust that is required in execution of the transactions, the risk of the
third party being compromised, and the costs and time required forthe payment to be completed and cleared to allow the recipient tospend it.
Both forms of payment have their advantages and drawbacks, and
most people resort to a combination of the two in their economictransactions. Before the invention of Bitcoin, intermediated paymentsincluded (though were not limited to) all forms of digital payment. The
nature of digital objects, since the inception of computers, is that they
are not scarce. They can be reproduced endlessly, and as such it wasimpossible to make a currency out of them, because sending them willonly duplicate them. Any form of electronic payment had to be carriedout via an intermediary because of the danger of double-spending:
there was no way of guaranteeing that the payer was being honest with
hisfunds,andnotusingthemmorethanonce,unlesstherewasatrustedTrim Size: 6in x 9in Ammous c08.tex V1 - 03/05/2018 1:09pm Page 170 k

third party overseeing the account and able to verify the integrity of the
payments carried out. Cash transactions were confined to the physical
realm of direct contact, while all digital forms of payments had to be
supervised by a third party.
After years of innovative trial and error by many programmers, and
through relying on a wide range of technologies, Bitcoin was the first
engineering solution that allowed for digital payments without having
to rely on a trusted third-party intermediary. By being the first digital
object that is verifiably scarce, Bitcoin is the first example of digitalcash .
Thereareseveraldrawbackstotransactingthroughtrustedthirdpar-
ties which make digital cash a valuable proposition for many. Third
parties are by their very nature an added security weakness1—involving
an extra party in your transaction inherently introduces risk, because it
opensupnewpossibilitiesfortheftortechnicalfailure.Further,payment
through intermediaries leaves the parties vulnerable to surveillance and
bansbypoliticalauthorities.Inotherwords,whenresortingtoanyform
of digital payment, there was no alternative to trusting in a third party,and whichever political authorities rule over it, and being subject to the
risk of the political authority stopping the payment under pretexts of
security,terrorism,ormoneylaundering.Tomakemattersworse,inter-mediatedpaymentsalwaysinvolveariskoffraud,whichraisestransaction
costs and delays final settlement of payments.
In other words, intermediated payments take away a significant share
of the properties of money as a medium of exchange controlled by its
owner, with high liquidity for him to sell whenever he wants. Of themost persistent characteristics of money historically are fungibility (any
unit of money is equivalent to any other unit), and liquidity (ability of
the owner to sell quickly at market price). People choose moneys thatare fungible and liquid because they want sovereignty over their money.
Sovereign money contains within it all the permission needed to spend
it; the desire for others to hold it exceeds the ability of others to impose
controls on it.
While intermediated payments compromise some of the desirable
features of money, these shortcomings are not present in physical cash

distancesthankstomoderntelecommunication,physicalcashtransactionsbecomeprohibitivelyimpractical.Themovetowarddigitalpaymentswas
reducing the amount of sovereignty people have over their own money
and leaving them subject to the whims of the third parties they had nochoice but to trust. Further, the move from gold, which is money thatnobody can print, toward fiat currencies whose supply is controlled bycentral banks further reduced people’s sovereignty over their wealth and
left them helpless in the face of the slow erosion of the value of their
money as central banks inflated the money supply to fund governmentoperation. It became increasingly impractical to accumulate capital andwealthwithoutthepermissionofthegovernmentissuingthatmoney.
Satoshi Nakamoto’s motivation for Bitcoin was to create a “purely
peer-to-peer form of electronic cash” that would not require trust inthird parties for transactions and whose supply cannot be altered by anyotherparty.Inotherwords,Bitcoinwouldbringthedesirablefeaturesofphysicalcash(lackofintermediaries,finalityoftransactions)tothedigital

be manipulated to produce unexpected inflation to benefit an outsideparty at the expense of holders. Nakamoto succeeded in achieving thisthroughtheutilizationofafewimportantthoughnotwidelyunderstoodtechnologies:adistributedpeer-to-peernetworkwithnosinglepointof

Nakamoto removed the need for trust in a third party by building
Bitcoin on a foundation of very thorough and ironclad proofandver-
ification. It is fair to say that the central operational feature of Bitcoin
is verification, and only because of that can Bitcoin remove the need
for trust completely.3Every transaction has to be recorded by every
member of the network so that they all share one common ledger ofbalances and transactions. Whenever a member of the network transfersa sum to another member, all network members can verify the sender
has a sufficient balance, and nodes compete to be the first to update

the ledger with a new block of transactions every ten minutes. In order
for a node to commit a block of transactions to the ledger, it has toexpend processing power on solving complicated mathematical prob-
lems that are hard to solve but whose correct solution is easy to verify.
This is the proof-of-work (PoW) system, and only with a correct solu-tion can a block be committed and verified by all network members.While these mathematical problems are unrelated to the Bitcoin trans-actions, they are indispensable to the operation of the system as they
force the verifying nodes to expend processing power which would be
wasted if they included fraudulent transactions. Once a node solves theproof-of-work correctly and announces the transactions, other nodeson the network vote for its validity, and once a majority has voted toapprove the block, nodes begin committing transactions to a new block
to be amended to the previous one and solving the new proof-of-work
forit.Crucially,thenodethatcommitsavalidblockoftransactionstothenetwork receives a block reward consisting of brand-new bitcoins added
to the supply along with all the transaction fees paid by the people who
are transacting.
Thisprocessiswhatisreferredtoas mining,analogoustothemining
ofpreciousmetals,andiswhynodesthatsolveproof-of-workareknownas miners. This block reward compensates the miners for the resourcesthey committed to proof-of-work. Whereas in a modern central bank
the new money created goes to finance lending and government spend-
ing, in Bitcoin the new money goes only to those who spend resourceson updating the ledger. Nakamoto programmed Bitcoin to produce anew block roughly every ten minutes, and for each block to contain areward of 50 coins in the first four years of Bitcoin’s operation, to be
halved afterwards to 25 coins, and further halved every four years.
The quantity of bitcoins created is preprogrammed and cannot
be altered no matter how much effort and energy is expended onproof-of-work. This is achieved through a process called difficultyadjustment, which is perhaps the most ingenious aspect of Bitcoin’s
design. As more people choose to hold Bitcoin, this drives up the
market value of Bitcoin and makes mining new coins more profitable,which drives more miners to expend more resources on solvingproof-of-work problems. More miners means more processing power,which would result in the solutions to the proof-of-work being arrivedTrim Size: 6in x 9in Ammous c08.tex V1 - 03/05/2018 1:09pm Page 173 k

possibly increase its supply; it can only make the network more secureand immune to attack.

another, not producing money, an activity with no added value to soci-ety because any supply of money is enough to run any economy. Goldbecame the prime money of every civilized society precisely because itwas the hardest to produce, but Bitcoin’s difficulty adjustment makes it
even harder to produce. A massive increase in the price of gold will, in
the long run, lead to larger quantities being produced, but no matterhow high the price of bitcoins rises, the supply stays the same and thesafety of the network only increases.
The security of Bitcoin lies in the asymmetry between the cost
of solving the proof-of-work necessary to commit a transaction to
the ledger and the cost of verifying its validity. It costs ever-increasingquantities of electricity and processing power to record transactions, butthe cost of verifying the validity of the transactions is close to zero andwill remain at that level no matter how much Bitcoin grows.

waste resources on solving the proof-of-work only to watch nodes
reject it at almost no cost, thereby withholding the block reward from

once that the Bitcoin ledger of transactions might just be the only objective set of facts in the world.You could argue (as many philosophers do) that every fact is subjective and its truthfulness is based onthe person stating or hearing it, but the Bitcoin ledger of transactions is created through convertingelectricity and processing power to truth without having to rely on the word of anyone.
5The only way to own bitcoins is to have control of the private keys. Should someone manage to gain
access to your private keys, they have your bitcoins. Theft of private keys is like theft of physical dollarsor gold; it is final and irreversible. There is no authority you can call to rescind the theft. This is anunavoidable part of Bitcoin being cash and an important point that potential investors in Bitcoin needto understand full well before putting any sum of money into Bitcoin. Securing the private keys is not
a simple task, and not being able to secure them is very risky.Trim Size: 6in x 9in Ammous c08.tex V1 - 03/05/2018 1:09pm Page 175 k

100,000,000 satoshis, making it highly salable across scales. Whereas the
Yapese stones were only practical for a few transactions in a small island
with a small population who knew each other very well, Bitcoin has far
superior salability across space, because the digital ledger is accessible byanyone worldwide with an Internet connection.
What keeps Bitcoin nodes honest, individually, is that if they were
dishonest, they would be discovered immediately, making dishonesty
exactly as effective as doing nothing but involving a higher cost.Collectively, what prevents a majority from colluding to be dishonest
is that if they were to succeed in compromising the integrity of the
ledger of transactions, the entire value proposition of Bitcoin wouldbe destroyed and the bitcoin tokens’ value would collapse to nothing.Collusion costs a lot, but it would itself lead to its loot becoming
worthless. In other words, Bitcoin relies on economic incentives,
making fraud far costlier than its rewards.
No single entity is relied upon for maintaining the ledger and no
single individual can alter the record on it without the consent of a
majorityofnetworkmembers.Whatdeterminesthevalidityofthetrans-

Ralph Merkle, inventor of the Merkle tree data structure, which
is utilized by Bitcoin to record transactions, had a remarkable way ofdescribing Bitcoin:
Bitcoin is the first example of a new form of life. It lives and breathes
ontheinternet.Itlivesbecauseitcanpaypeopletokeepitalive.Itlivesbecause it performs a useful service that people will pay it to perform.It lives because anyone, anywhere, can run a copy of its code. It livesbecause all the running copies are constantly talking to each other. Itlives because if any one copy is corrupted it is discarded, quickly andwithout any fuss or muss. It lives because it is radically transparent:anyone can see its code and see exactly what it does.
It can’t be changed. It can’t be argued with. It can’t be tampered
with. It can’t be corrupted. It can’t be stopped. It can’t even beinterrupted.
If nuclear war destroyed half of our planet, it would continue to
live, uncorrupted. It would continue to offer its services. It wouldcontinue to pay people to keep it alive.Trim Size: 6in x 9in Ammous c08.tex V1 - 03/05/2018 1:09pm Page 176 k

Nobody is essential to Bitcoin, and ifanybody wants to alter Bitcoin, Bitcoin is perfectly capable of continu-ing to operate as it is without whatever input anyone has on this.

Bitcoin can also be understood as a spontaneously emergent and
autonomous firm which provides a new form of money and a newpayments network. There is no management or corporate structureto this firm, as all decisions are automated and preprogrammed.
Volunteer coders in an open source project can present changes and
improvements to the code, but it is up to users to choose to adoptthem or not. The value proposition of this firm is that its moneysupply is completely inelastic in response to increased demand andprice; instead, increased demand just leads to a safer network due to themining difficulty adjustment. Miners invest electricity and processingpower in the mining infrastructure that protects the network becausethey are rewarded for it. Bitcoin users pay transaction fees and buy the

coins from the miners because they want to utilize digital cash and
benefit from the appreciation over time, and in the process they financethe miners’ investment in operating the network. The investment in
PoW mining hardware makes the network more secure and can be
understood as the firm’s capital. The more the demand for the networkgrows, the more valuable the miners’ rewards and transaction feesbecome, which necessitates more processing power to generate newcoins, increasing the company’s capital, making the network moresecure and the coins harder to produce. It is an economic arrangementthat has been productive and lucrative to everyone involved, which in
turn leads to the network continuing to grow at an astonishing pace.
With this technological design, Nakamoto was able to invent digital
scarcity. Bitcoin is the first example of a digital good that is scarce and
cannotbereproducedinfinitely.Whileitistrivialtosendadigitalobjectfromonelocationtoanotherinadigitalnetwork,asisdonewithemail,text messaging, or file downloads, it is more accurate to describe these

Beyond digital scarcity, Bitcoin is also the first example of absolute
scarcity, the only liquid commodity (digital or physical) with a set fixed
quantity that cannot conceivably be increased. Until the invention of
Bitcoin,scarcitywasalwaysrelative,neverabsolute.Itisacommonmis-
conception to imagine that any physical good is finite, or absolutelyscarce, because the limit on the quantity we can produce of any goodis never its prevalence in the planet, but the effort and time dedicatedto producing it.

supply growth is determined by a programmed function adopted by all
members of the network. There may have been a time at the start ofthis currency when this inflation schedule could have been conceiv-
ably changed, but that time has well passed. For all practical intents and

After setting this supply growth schedule, Satoshi divided each
bitcoin into 100,000,000 units, which were later named satoshis in his

This exposition can help us appreciate the salability of bitcoin and
how it fulfills the functions of money. With its supply growth rate drop-ping below that of gold by the year 2025, Bitcoin has the supply restric-tions that could make it have considerable demand as a store of value; in
otherwords,itcanhavesalabilityacrosstime.Itsdigitalnaturethatmakes
it easy to safely send worldwide makes it salable in space in a way neverseen with other forms of money, while its divisibility into 100,000,000satoshis makes it salable in scale. Further, Bitcoin’s elimination of inter-mediary control and the near-impossibility of any authority debasingor confiscating it renders it free of the main drawbacks of governmentmoney. As the digital age has introduced improvements and efficienciesto most aspects of our life, Bitcoin presents a tremendous technolog-ical leap forward in the monetary solution to the indirect exchange
problem, perhaps as significant as the move from cattle and salt to gold
and silver.

The market demand for a bitcoin token comes from the fact that
it is needed to operate the first (and so far, arguably only) functional
and reliable digital cash system.11The fact that this network was suc-
cessfully operational in its early days gave its digital token a collectiblevalue among tiny communities of cryptographers and libertarians, who
tried mining it with their own PCs, and eventually even started pur-
chasing it from one another.
12That the tokens were strictly limited and
could not be replicated helped create this initial collectible status. After
beingacquiredbyindividualstouseontheBitcoinnetwork,andgaining
economic value, Bitcoin began to get monetized through more people
demanding it as a store of value. This sequence of activities conforms
to Ludwig von Mises’ Theory of Regression on the origins of money,which states that a monetary good begins as a market good and is then
used as a medium of exchange. Bitcoin’s collectible status among small
communities is no different from seashells’, Rai stones’, and preciousmetals’ ornamental value, from which they were to acquire a monetary
role that raised their value significantly.
Being new and only beginning to spread, Bitcoin’s price has fluctu-
ated wildly as demand fluctuates, but the impossibility of increasing the

For the bitcoin price to rise, people must hold it as a store of value,
and not just spend it. Without a number of people willing to holdthe currency for a significant period of time, continued selling of the
currency will keep its price down and prevent it from appreciating.

By November 2017, the total market value of all the bitcoins in
circulation was in the range of $110 billion, giving it a value larger thanthe broad money supply of the national currencies of most countries.If Bitcoin were a country, the value of its currency would be the 56thlargest national currency worldwide, roughly in the range of the sizeof the money supply of Kuwait or Bangladesh, larger than that ofMorocco and Peru, but smaller than Colombia and Pakistan. If it wereto be compared to the narrow money supply, Bitcoin’s supply valuewould be ranked around the 33rd in the world, with a value similar tothe narrow money supply of Brazil, Turkey, and South Africa.

perhaps one of the most remarkable achievements of the Internet thatan online economy that spontaneously and voluntarily emerged arounda network designed by an anonymous programmer has grown, in nineyears, to hold more value than is held in the money supply of mostnation-states and national currencies

Further, with the currentsize of Bitcoin blocks being limited to 1 megabyte, 500,000 transactionsper day is close to the upper limit that can be carried out by the Bitcoinnetwork and recorded by all peers on the network. Even as this limit
is reached and its presence is well-publicized, the growth in the value

The peculiar nature of Bitcoin transactions makes ithard to precisely estimate the exact value of transactions in bitcoins orU.S. dollars, but a lower-bound estimate sees an average daily volumeof around 260,000 bitcoins in 2017, with highly volatile growth overBitcoin’s lifetime.

to pick them up. In the early days when the number of transactionswas small, miners would process transactions that did not include a fee
because the block subsidy of new coins itself was worth the effort. As
demand for Bitcoin transactions grew, miners could afford to be moreselective and prioritize transactions with higher fees. Fees were under$0.1 per transaction up until late 2015, and started rising above $1 per
transaction around early 2016. With the quick rise in Bitcoin’s price in

For any regular commodity, the varia-tion in demand will affect the production decisions of producers of thecommodity: an increase in demand causes them to increase their pro-duction, moderating the rise in the price and allowing them to increase
their profitability, while a decrease in demand would cause producers to
decrease their supply and allow them to minimize losses. A similar situ-ation exists with national currencies, where central banks are expectedto maintain relative stability in the purchasing power of their currenciesby setting the parameters of their monetary policy to counteract mar-ket fluctuations. With a supply schedule utterly irresponsive to demand,and no central bank to manage the supply, there will likely be volatility,

Butasthesizeofthemarketgrows,alongwiththesophisticationand
the depth of the financial institutions dealing with Bitcoin, this volatil-ity will likely decline. With a larger and more liquid market, the dailyvariations in demand are likely to become relatively smaller, allowing
market makers to profit from hedging price variations and smoothing
the price. This will only be achieved if and when a large number ofmarket participants hold bitcoins with the intent of holding onto themfor the long term, raising the market value of the supply of bitcoins sig-
nificantly and making a large liquid market possible with only a fraction
of the supply. Should the network reach a stable size at any point, theflow of funds in and out of it would be relatively equal and the priceof bitcoin can stabilize. In such a case, Bitcoin would gain more stabil-
ity while also having enough liquidity to not move significantly with
daily market transactions. But as long as Bitcoin continues to grow inadoption, its appreciation attracts more adopters to it, leading to fur-ther appreciation, making this drop in volatility further away. As long
as Bitcoin is growing, its token price will behave like that of a stock of

kAppendix to Chapter 8
The following is a brief description of three technologies utilized by
Bitcoin:
Hashing is a process that can take any stream of data as an input
and transform it into a dataset of fixed size (known as a hash) using anon-reversible mathematical formula. In other words, it is trivial to usethis function to generate a uniform-sized hash for any piece of data, butit is not possible to determine the original string of data from the hash.
Hashing is essential for the operation of Bitcoin as it is used in digital
signatures, proof-of-work, Merkle trees, transaction identifiers, Bitcoinaddresses, and various other applications. Hashing in essence allowsidentifying a piece of data in public without revealing anything aboutthat data, which can be used to securely and trustlessly see if multipleparties have the same data.
Public key cryptography isamethodforauthenticationthatrelies
on a set of mathematically related numbers: a private key, a public key,andoneormoresignatures.Theprivatekey,whichmust bekeptsecret,can generate a public key that can be distributed freely because it is notpossible to determine the private key by examining the public key. Thismethod is used for authentication: after someone publicizes his public

key,hecanhashsomedataandthensignthathashwithhisprivatekeyto
create a signature. Anyone with the same data can create the same hash
andseethatitwasusedtocreatethesignature;thenshecancomparethe
signature to the public key she previously received and see that they’rebothmathematicallyrelated,provingthatthepersonwiththeprivatekey
signed the data covered by the hash. Bitcoin utilizes public key cryptog-
raphy to allow secure value exchange over an open unsecured network.A bitcoin holder can only access his bitcoins if he has the private keys
attached to them, while the public address associated with them can be
distributed widely. All network members can verify the validity of thetransaction by verifying that the transactions sending the money came
from the owner of the right private key. In Bitcoin, the only form of
ownership that exists is through the ownership of the private keys.
Peer-to-peer network is a network structure in which all mem-
bers have equal privileges and obligations toward one another. There
are no central coordinators who can change the rules of the network.Node operators that disagree with how the network functions cannot
impose their opinions on other members of the network or override
their privileges. The most well-known example of a peer-to-peernetwork is BitTorrent, a protocol for sharing files online. Whereas in
centralized networks members download files from a central server that
hosts them, in BitTorrent, users download files from each other directly,divided into small pieces. Once a user has downloaded a piece of the
file, they can become a seed for that file, allowing others to download
it from them. With this design, a large file can spread relatively quicklywithout the need for large servers and extensive infrastructure to
distribute it, while also protecting against the possibility of a single
point of failure compromising the process. Every file that is shared onthe network is protected by a cryptographic hash that can be easily
verified to ensure that any nodes sharing it have not corrupted it.
After law enforcement had cracked down on centralized file-sharingwebsites such as Napster, BitTorrent’s decentralized nature meant lawenforcement could never shut it down. With a growing network of
users worldwide, BitTorrent at some point represented about a third
of all Internet traffic worldwide. Bitcoin utilizes a network similar toBitTorrent, but whereas in BitTorrent the network members share
the bits of data that constitute a movie, song, or book, in Bitcoin the
network members share the ledger of all Bitcoin transactions.Trim Size: 6in x 9in Ammous c09.tex V1 - 03/05/2018 1:09pm Page 193 k

What Is Bitcoin
Good For?
Store of Value
The belief that resources are scarce and limited is a misunderstanding
of the nature of scarcity, which is the key concept behind economics.
The absolute quantity of every raw material present in earth is too largefor us as human beings to even measure or comprehend, and in no wayconstitutes a real limit to what we as humans can produce of it. Wehave barely scratched the surface of the earth in search of the mineralswe need, and the more we search, and the deeper we dig, the moreresources we find. What constitutes the practical and realistic limit tothe quantity of any resource is always the amount of human time that isdirectedtowardproducingit,asthatistheonlyrealscarceresource(untilthe creation of Bitcoin). In his masterful book, The Ultimate Resource ,
the late economist Julian Simon explains how the only limited resource,and in fact the only thing for which the term resourceactually applies, is

different goods and services. More of any good can always be produced
if human time goes toward it. The real cost of a good, then, is always itsopportunity cost in terms of goods forgone to produce it.
In all human history, we have never run out of any single raw mate-

year, the proven reserves increase at an even faster rate.1According to
data from BP’s statistical review, annual oil production was 46% higher
in 2015 than its level in 1980, while consumption was 55% higher. Oil
reserves, on the other hand, have increased by 148%, around triple the
increase in production and consumption.
Similar statistics can be produced for resources with varying degrees
of prevalence in the earth’s crust. The rarity of a resource determines
the relative cost of extracting it from the earth. More prevalent metals
like iron and copper are easy to find, and relatively cheap as a result.Rarer metals, such as silver and gold, are more expensive. The limit on
how much we can produce of each of those metals, however, remains
the opportunity cost of their production relative to one another, and
not their absolute quantity. There is no better evidence for this than
the fact that the rarest metal in the crust of the earth, gold, has beenmined for thousands of years and continues to be mined in increasing
quantities as technology advances over time, as shown in Chapter 3. If
annual production of the rarest metal in the earth’s crust goes up everyyear, then it makes no sense to talk of any natural element as being
limited in its quantity in any practical sense. Scarcity is only relative in
material resources, with the differences in cost of extraction being thedeterminant of the level of scarcity. The only scarcity, as Julian Simon
brilliantly demonstrated, is in the time humans have to produce these
metals, and that is why the global wage continues to rise worldwide,
making products and materials continuously get cheaper in terms of
human labor.
Thisisonethehardesteconomicconceptsforpeopletounderstand,
which fuels the endless hysteria that the environmental movement has
foisted upon us through decades of apocalyptic scaremongering. JulianSimon did his best to combat this hysteria by challenging one of the

ofeachofthesemetals,adjustedforinflation,wouldbelowerattheend
of the period than before it. Ehrlich picked copper, chromium, nickel,
tin, and tungsten, which were all materials he had predicted would runout.Yet,in1990,thepriceofeachofthesemetalshaddropped,andthe
level of annual production had increased, even though the intervening
decade had seen human population increase by 800 million people, thelargest increase in a single decade before or since.
In reality, the more humans exist, the more production of all these
raw materials can take place. More importantly, perhaps, as economistMichael Kremer
2argues, the fundamental driver of human progress is
not raw materials, but technological solutions to problems. Technology
is by its nature both a non-excludable good (meaning that once one per-
son invents something, all others can copy it and benefit from it) and a
non-rival good (meaning that a person benefiting from an invention does
not reduce the utility that accrues to others who use it). As an example,take the wheel. Once one person invented it, everyone else could copy
it and make their own wheel, and their use of their wheel would not
in any way reduce others’ ability to benefit from it. Ingenious ideas arerare,andonlyasmallminorityofpeoplecancomeupwiththem.Largerpopulations will thus produce more technologies and ideas than smaller
populations, and because the benefit accrues to everyone, it is better to
live in a world with a larger population. The more humans exist onearth, the more technologies and productive ideas are thought of, and
the more humans can benefit from these ideas and copy them from one
another, leading to higher productivity of human time and improvingstandards of living.

for sustaining larger populations. Further, Kremer shows how isolated
landmasses that were more heavily populated witnessed faster economicgrowth and progress than those that were sparsely populated.
It is a misnomer to call raw materials resources, because humans
are not passive consumers of manna from heaven. Raw materials are
always the product of human labor and ingenuity and thus humans are
the ultimate resource, because human time, effort, and ingenuity canalways be used to produce more output.
The eternal dilemma humans face with their time concerns how to
store the value they produce with their time through the future. While
human time is finite, everything else is practically infinite, and more of
itcanbeproducedifmorehumantimeisdirectedatit.Whateverobjecthumans chose as a store of value, its value would rise, and because moreof the object can always be made, others would produce more of the
object to acquire the value stored in it. The Yapese had O’Keefe bring-
ingexplosivesandadvancedboatstomakemoreRaistonesforthemandacquire the value stored in the existing stones. Africans had Europeansbringing boats full of beads to acquire the value stored in their beads.Any metal other than gold that was used as a monetary medium was
overproduced until its price collapsed. Modern economies have Keyne-
sian central banks forever pretending to fight inflation while graduallyor quickly eroding the value of their money, as discussed in Chapter 4.As Americans recently started using their homes as a medium for sav-ings, the supply of housing was increased so much that the price came
crashing down. As monetary inflation proceeds, the large number of
bubbles can be understood as speculative bets for ways to find a usefulstore of value. Only gold has come close to solving this problem, thankstoitschemistrymakingitimpossibleforanyonetoinflateitssupply,andthat resulted in one of the most glorious eras of human history. But the

In2018,withBitcoinonlynineyearsold,ithasalreadybeenadopted

that of the global reserve currencies. In terms of the stock-to-flow ratiodiscussed in Chapter 1, the existing stockpiles of Bitcoin in 2017 werearound25timeslargerthanthenewcoinsproducedin2017.Thisisstillless than half of the ratio for gold, but around the year 2022, Bitcoin’sstock-to-flow ratio will overtake that of gold, and by 2025, it will bearound double that of gold and continue to increase quickly into thefuture while that of gold stays roughly the same, given the dynamics ofgoldmining discussed in Chapter 3. Around the year 2140 there will beno new supply of Bitcoin, and the stock-to-flow ratio becomes infinite,the first time any commodity or good has achieved this.
An important implication of the reduced supply of bitcoins and the
continuously diminishing rate at which the supply grows is to makethe supply of existing bitcoins very large compared to the new supply.In that sense, Bitcoin mining is similar to goldmining, thus ensuringthat as a monetary medium, relatively less time and effort would gotoward securing new supplies of Bitcoin than other moneys whosesupply can be increased easily; and more time and effort is dedicatedtoward useful economic production which can then be exchangedfor bitcoins. As the block subsidy declines, the resources dedicated tomining bitcoins will be mainly rewarded for processing the transactionsand thus securing the network, rather than for the creation of newcoins.

Individual Sovereignty
As the first form of digital cash, Bitcoin’s first and most important valueproposition is in giving anyone in the world access to sovereign base
money. Any person who owns Bitcoin achieves a degree of economic

The significance of this invention for the political realities of
the twenty-first century is that, for the first time since the emergenceof the modern state, individuals have a clear technical solution to escap-ing the financial clout of the governments they live under. Remarkably,the best description of the significance of such a technology can befoundinabookwrittenin1997,afull12yearsbeforeBitcoin’screation,
which foresaw a digital currency remarkably similar to Bitcoin, and the
impact it would have on transforming human society.

Five hundred years later, it is industrial society and the modern
nation-state that have become repressive, sclerotic, and burdensomewhile new technology eats away at its power and raison d’être.
“Microprocessors will subvert and destroy the nation-state” is the
provocative thesis of the book. New forms of organization will emergefrom information technology, destroying the capacity of the state toforce citizens to pay more for its services than they wish. The digitalrevolution will destroy the power of the modern state over its citizens,
reducethesignificanceofthenation-stateasanorganizingunit,andgive
individuals unprecedented power and sovereignty over their own lives.
We can already see this process taking place thanks to the telecom-
munication revolution. Whereas the printing press allowed the poor ofthe world to access knowledge that was forbidden them and monop-
olized by the churches, it still had the limitation of producing physical
books which could always be confiscated, banned, or burned. No suchthreat exists in the cyber-world, where virtually all human knowledgeexists, readily available for individuals to access without any possibility
for effective government control or censorship.
Similarly, information is allowing trade and employment to subvert
government restrictions and regulations, as best exemplified by compa-nies like Uber and Airbnb, which have not asked for government per-mission to introduce their products successfully and subvert traditional
forms of regulation and supervision. Modern individuals can transact
withotherstheymeetonlineviasystemsofidentityandprotectionbuilton consent and mutual respect, without any need for resort to coercivegovernment regulations.

such physical means of production. Productive capital becomes more
embodied in the individuals themselves, making the threat of violentlyappropriatingitincreasinglyhollow,asindividuals’productivitybecomes
inextricably linked to their consent. When peasants’ productivity and
survivalwastiedtothelandthattheydidnotown,thethreatofviolencewas effective in getting them to be productive to benefit the landowner.Similarly, industrial society’s heavy reliance on physical productivecapital and its tangible output made expropriation by the state relatively
straightforward, as the twentieth century so bloodily illustrated. But as
the individual’s mental capacities become the prime productive forceof society, the threat of violence becomes far less effective. Humanscan easily move to jurisdictions where they are not threatened, or canbe productive on computers without governments being able to even
know what they are producing.
There was one final piece in the puzzle of digitization that had
been missing, and that is the transfer of money and value. Even asinformation technology could subvert geographic and governmental
controls and restrictions, payments continued to be heavily controlled
by governments and the state-enforced banking monopolies. Like allgovernment-enforced monopolies, banking had for years resisted inno-vations and changes that benefit the consumers and restrict their abilityto extract fees and rents. This was a monopoly that grew ever more
burdensome as the global economy spread and became more global.
Davidson and Rees-Mogg predict with remarkable prescience the formthat the new digital monetary escape hatch will take: cryptographicallysecured forms of money independent of all physical restrictions thatcannot be stopped or confiscated by government authorities. While this
seemed like an outlandish prediction when the book was written, it is
now a vivid reality already utilized by millions worldwide, though thesignificance of it is not widely understood.

reliant on it for their survival and well-being. The historical version
of sound money, gold, did not have these advantages. Gold’s physical-ity made it vulnerable to government control. That gold could not bemoved around easily meant that payments using it had to be centralizedin banks and central banks, making confiscation easy. With Bitcoin, on
the other hand, verifying transactions is trivial and virtually costless, as
anyone can access the transactions ledger from any Internet-connecteddevice for free
5. While Bitcoin’s scaling will likely require the use of
third-party intermediaries, this will be different from gold settlement inseveral very important respects. First, the dealings of the third partieswill ultimately all be settled on a publicly accessible ledger, allowing formore transparency and auditing. Bitcoin offers the modern individualthe chance to opt out of the totalitarian, managerial, Keynesian, andsocialist states. It is a simple technological fix to the modern pestilenceof governments surviving by exploiting the productive individuals who
happen to live on their soil. If Bitcoin continues to grow to capture a
larger share of the global wealth, it may force governments to becomemoreandmoreaformofvoluntaryorganization,whichcanonlyacquireits “taxes” voluntarily by offering its subjects services they would bewilling to pay for.
The political vision of Bitcoin can be understood from a closer
examination of the ideas of the cypherpunk movement from which itsprung. In the words of Timothy May:
The combination of strong, unbreakable public key cryptography and
virtual network communities in cyberspace will produce interestingand profound changes in the nature of economic and social systems.Crypto anarchy is the cyberspatial realization of anarcho-capitalism,transcending national boundaries and freeing individuals to make theeconomic arrangements they wish to make consensually... Cryptoanarchy is liberating individuals from coercion by their physicalneighbors–who cannot know who they are on the Net–and fromgovernments. For libertarians, strong crypto provides the means bywhich government will be avoided.

k204 THE BITCOIN STANDARD
The vision of anarcho-capitalism May describes is the political
philosophy developed by the American economist of the Austrianschool, Murray Rothbard. In The Ethics of Liberty Rothbard explains
libertarian anarcho-capitalism as the only logically coherent implication
of the idea of free will and self-ownership:
Ontheotherhand,considertheuniversalstatusoftheethicofliberty,
andofthenaturalrightofpersonandpropertythatobtainsundersuchan ethic. For every person, at any time or place, can be covered by thebasic rules: ownership of one’s own self, ownership of the previouslyunused resources which one has occupied and transformed; and own-ership of all titles derived from that basic ownership–either throughvoluntary exchanges or voluntary gifts. These rules–which we mightcall the “rules of natural ownership”–can clearly be applied, and such
ownership defended, regardless of the time or place, and regardless of
the economic attainments of the society. It is impossible for any othersocialsystemtoqualifyasuniversalnaturallaw;forifthereisanycoer-cive rule by oneperson or group overanother (and all rule partakes ofsuch hegemony), then it is impossible to apply the same rule for all;only a rulerless, purely libertarian world can fulfill the qualificationsof natural rights and natural law, or, more important, can fulfill theconditions of a universal ethic for all mankind.

The non-aggression principle is the foundation of Rothbard’s
anarcho-capitalism, and on its basis, any aggression, whether carried
out by government or individual, cannot have moral justification.Bitcoin, being completely voluntary and relentlessly peaceful, offersus the monetary infrastructure for a world built purely on voluntarycooperation.Contrarytopopulardepictionsofanarchistsashoodie-clad
hoodlums, Bitcoin’s brand of anarchism is completely peaceful, pro-
viding individuals with the tools necessary for them to be free fromgovernment control and inflation. It seeks to impose itself on nobody,and if it grows and succeeds, it will be for its own merits as a peacefulneutral technology for money and settlement, not through it being
forced on others.

adoption, Bitcoin provides a cost-effective option for people needing to

International and Online Settlement
Traditionally, gold was the medium of settlement of payments and storeofvalueworldwide.Theinabilityofanypartytoexpanditssupplyinanysignificantquantitiesmadeitso.Itsvaluewasearnedonthefreemarket,and not a liability of anyone else. As the scope of communication andtravel grew larger in the nineteenth century, requiring financial transac-tions over longer distances, gold moved out of people’s hands and into
thevaultsofbanks,andeventually,centralbanks.Underagoldstandard,
people held paper receipts in gold or wrote checks for it that clearedwithout physical gold having to be physically moved, vastly improvingthe speed and efficiency of global trade.
As governments confiscated gold and issued their own money, it
was no longer possible for global settlements between individuals and
banks to be done with gold, and instead they were conducted with
national currencies fluctuating in value, creating significant problemsfor international trade, as discussed in Chapter 6. The invention ofBitcoin has created, from the ground up, a new independent alternativemechanism for international settlement that does not rely on any inter-mediary and can operate entirely separate from the existing financial
infrastructure.Trim Size: 6in x 9in Ammous c09.tex V1 - 03/05/2018 1:09pm Page 206 k

k206 THE BITCOIN STANDARD
TheabilityofanyindividualtorunaBitcoinnodeandsendhisown
money without permission from anyone, and without having to exposehis identity, is a noteworthy difference between gold and Bitcoin.
Bitcoin does not have to be stored on a computer; the private key to
a person’s bitcoin hoard is a string of characters or a string of wordsthe person remembers. It is far easier to move around with a Bitcoinprivate key than with a hoard of gold, and far easier to send it across theworld without having to risk it getting stolen or confiscated. Whereas
governments confiscated people’s gold savings and forced them to trade
with money supposedly backed by that gold, people are able to keepthe bulk of their bitcoin savings in storage away from government’shands and only use smaller amounts to transact through intermediaries.The very nature of the Bitcoin technology puts governments at a severe
disadvantage compared to all other forms of money and thus makes
confiscation much harder.
Further,theabilityofbitcoinholderstotrackallholdingsofbitcoin

the role of a lender of last resort for banks dealing with Bitcoin. Even in
the heyday of the international gold standard,money was redeemableingold, but central banks rarely had enough to cover the entire supply ofcurrency they introduced, and thus always had a margin for increasingthe supply of paper to back up the currency. This is much harder with
Bitcoin, which brings cryptographic digital certainty to accounting and
can help expose banks engaging in fractional reserve banking.
The future use of Bitcoin for small payments will likely not be car-
ried out over the distributed ledger, as explained in the discussion onscaling in Chapter 10, but through second layers. Bitcoin can be seen
as the new emerging reserve currency for online transactions, where
the online equivalent of banks will issue Bitcoin-backed tokens to userswhile keeping their hoard of Bitcoins in cold storage, with each indi-vidual being able to audit in real time the holdings of the intermediary,andwithonlineverificationandreputationsystemsabletoverifythatno

more like a reserve currency than a currency for everyday trading and
transactions. Even at the time of writing, with Bitcoin at a relativelysmall level of public adoption, the majority of Bitcoin transactions are
not recorded on-chain, but occur in exchanges and various types of
Bitcoin-based online platforms such as gambling and casino websites.These businesses will credit or debit bitcoins to their customers on theirown internal records and then only make transactions on the Bitcoinnetwork when customers deposit or withdraw funds.
By virtue of being digital cash, Bitcoin’s comparative advantage
may not lie in replacing cash payments, but rather in allowing for cashpayments to be carried out over long distances. Payments in person, forsmall amounts, can be conducted in a wide variety of options: physicalcash, barter, favors, credit cards, bank checks, and so on. Current
state-of-the-art technology in payment settlements has already intro-
ducedawidearrayofoptionsforsettlingsmall-scalepaymentswithverylittle cost. It is likely that Bitcoin’s advantage lies not in competing withthese payments for small amounts and over short distances; Bitcoin’s
advantage, rather, is that by bringing the finality of cash settlement to
the digital world, it has created the fastest method for final settlementof large payments across long distances and national borders. It is whencompared to these payments that Bitcoin’s advantages appear most sig-nificant. There are only a few currencies that are accepted for payment
worldwide, namely the U.S. dollar, the euro, gold, and the IMF’s
Special Drawing Rights. The vast majority of international paymentsare denominated in one of these currencies, with only a tiny percentageshared by a few other major currencies. To send a few thousand dollars’worth of these currencies internationally usually costs dozens of dollars,
takes several days, and is subject to invasive forensic examination by
financial institutions. The high cost of these transactions lies primarilyin the volatility of trading currencies and the problems of settlementbetween institutions in different countries, which necessitates theemployment of several layers of intermediation.

liability, and is free of counterparty risk, but moving gold around is an
extremely expensive operational task, fraught with risks.
Bitcoin, having no counterparty risk and no reliance on any
third-party, is uniquely suited to play the same role that gold played inthe gold standard. It is a neutral money for an international system that
does not give any one country the “exorbitant privilege” of issuing
the global reserve currency, and is not dependent on its economicperformance. Being separated from any particular country’s economy,its value will not be affected by the volume of trade denominated in it,averting all the exchange rate problems that have plagued the twentieth
century. Further, the finality of settlement on Bitcoin does not rely on
any counterparty, and does not require any single bank to be the defacto arbiter, making it ideal for a network of global peers, rather thana global hegemonic centralized order. The Bitcoin network is basedon a form of money whose supply cannot be inflated by any single
member bank, making it a more attractive store-of-value proposition
than national currencies whose creation was precisely so their supplycould be increased to finance governments.
Bitcoin’s capacity for transactions is far more than what the current
number of central banks would need even if they settled their accountsTrim Size: 6in x 9in Ammous c09.tex V1 - 03/05/2018 1:09pm Page 209 k

daily. Bitcoin’s current capacity of around 350,000 transactions per day
can allow a global network of 850 banks to each have one daily trans-
action with every other bank on the network. (The number of unique
connections in a network equals n(n– 1)/2, where nis the number of
nodes.)
Aglobalnetworkof850centralbankscanperformdailyfinalsettle-
ment with one another over the Bitcoin network. If each central bank
serves around 10 million customers, that would cover the entire world’spopulation. This is offered as an absolute worst-case scenario in which
Bitcoin’s capacity is not increased in any way whatsoever. As will be
discussed in the next chapter, there are several ways in which capacitycan be increased even without altering the architecture of Bitcoin in
a backward-incompatible way, potentially allowing for daily settlement
between several thousands of banks.
In a world in which no government can create more bitcoins,
these Bitcoin central banks would compete freely with one another in
offering physical and digital bitcoin-backed monetary instruments and
payment solutions. Without a lender of last resort, fractional reservebanking becomes an extremely dangerous arrangement and it would be
my expectation the only banks that will survive in the long run would
be banks offering financial instruments 100% backed by Bitcoin. This,however, is a point of contention among economists and time can onlytell whether that will be the case. These banks would settle payments
between their own customers outside of Bitcoin’s blockchain and then
perform final daily settlement between each other over the blockchain.
While this view of Bitcoin might sound like it is a betrayal of
Bitcoin’s original vision of fully peer-to-peer cash, it is not a new
vision. Hal Finney, the recipient of the first Bitcoin transaction fromNakamoto, wrote this on the Bitcoin forum in 2010:
Actually there is a very good reason for Bitcoin-backed banks to
exist, issuing their own digital cash currency, redeemable for bitcoins.Bitcoin itself cannot scale to have every single financial transactionin the world be broadcast to everyone and included in the blockchain. There needs to be a secondary level of payment systems whichis lighter weight and more efficient.

Bitcoin backed banks will solve these problems. They can work
like banks did before nationalization of currency. Different banks can
havedifferentpolicies,somemoreaggressive,somemoreconservative.
Some would be fractional reserve while others may be 100% Bitcoinbacked. Interest rates may vary. Cash from some banks may trade at adiscount to that from others.
George Selgin has worked out the theory of competitive free

I believe this will be the ultimate fate of Bitcoin, to be the
“high-powered money” that serves as a reserve currency for banksthat issue their own digital cash. Most Bitcoin transactions will occurbetween banks, to settle net transfers. Bitcoin transactions by privateindividuals will be as rare as... well, as Bitcoin based purchases aretoday.

The number of transactions in a Bitcoin economy can still be as
large as it is today, but the settlement of these transactions will not hap-pen on Bitcoin’s ledger, whose immutability and trustlessness is far toovaluable for individual consumer payments. Whatever the limitations ofcurrent payment solutions, they will stand to benefit immensely from
the introduction of free market competition into the field of banking
and payments, one of the most sclerotic industries in the modern worldeconomy, because it is controlled by governments that can create themoney on which it runs.

experiencedover the past fewyears, it is likelyto attractthe attention of
central banks with an eye on the future.
If Bitcoin continues to appreciate significantly, it will provide the
central bank more flexibility with their monetary policy and interna-
tional account settlement. But perhaps the real case for central banksowning bitcoin is as insurance against the scenario of it succeeding.Given that the supply of bitcoins is strictly limited, it may be wise for acentral bank to spend a small amount acquiring a small portion of bit-
coin’s supply today in case it appreciates significantly in the future. If
bitcoin continues to appreciate while a central bank doesn’t own anyof it, then the market value of their reserve currencies and gold will bedeclining in terms of Bitcoin, placing the central bank at a disadvantagethe later it decides to acquire reserves.
Bitcoin is still viewed as a quirky Internet experiment for now, but

for later central banks to buy it. The wisest course of action in this case
is for a central bank to purchase a small share of Bitcoin. If the cen-tral bank has the institutional capacity to purchase the currency withoutannouncing it, that would be an even wiser course of action, allowingthe central bank to accumulate it at low prices.

competitor to their line of business, which has been closed off from
market competition for a century. Bitcoin makes global processing ofpayments and final clearance available for anyone to perform at a small
cost, and it replaces human-directed monetary policy with superior
and perfectly predictable algorithms. The modern central bank businessmodel is being disrupted. Central banks now have no way of stoppingcompetition by just passing laws as they have always done. They arenow up against a digital competitor that most likely cannot be broughtunder the physical world’s laws. Should national central banks not useBitcoin’s instant clearance and sound monetary policy, they would leave
the door open for digital upstarts to capture more and more of this
market for a store of value and settlement.

Global Unit of Account
This final application of Bitcoin is not one that is likely to material-ize any time soon, but is nonetheless intriguing given Bitcoin’s uniqueproperties. Since the end of the gold standard era, global trade has been
hampered by the differences in currency value across different coun-
tries. This destroyed people’s ability to conduct indirect exchange usinga single medium of exchange and instead created a world where buyingsomething across borders has to be preceded by buying the currency oftheproducer,almostmimickingbarter.Thishasseverelyhamperedpeo-ple’s ability to conduct economic calculation across borders and resulted

produces little of value but an amelioration of the terrible consequences
of monetary nationalism.
The gold standard offered a solution to this problem, wherein a
single form of money, independent of the control of any single govern-
ment or authority, was the monetary standard worldwide. Prices couldbe calibrated against gold and expressed in it, facilitating calculationacross borders. The physical heft of gold, however, meant that it hadto be centralized and settlement had to be carried out between central
banks.Oncethegoldwascentralized,itslureprovedirresistibleforgov-
ernments, who took control of it and eventually replaced it with fiatmoney whose supply they control. Sound money became unsound as aresult.

grow many multiples of its size and value very quickly. Should Bitcoin’s

population, with increasing demand for holding Bitcoin as a store of
value leading to only small appreciation of its value.
In the long run, the absence of any authority that can control
bitcoin’s supply will likely go from creating volatility in the price to
reducing it. The predictability of the supply combined with growthin the number of users could make daily fluctuations in demand lesssignificant determinants of price, as market makers are able to hedgeand smooth supply-and-demand fluctuations and create a more stable
price.
The situation would be similar to gold under the gold standard, as
detailed in Jastram’s study referenced in Chapter 6. For centuries duringwhich gold was used as money, the steady and gradual increase in itssupply meant that its value did not increase or decrease significantly,
making it the perfect unit of account across space and time.
But this scenario ignores one fundamental difference between gold
and Bitcoin, and that is that gold has large and highly elastic demandfor use in a multitude of industrial and ornamental applications. Gold’s

which inferior substitutes are only chosen due to gold’s high price.
Eveninascenariowhereallglobalcentralbanksdisposeofalltheirgoldreserves, jewelry and industrial demand is likely to absorb all that excesssupply with only temporary reductions in price. The rarity of gold inthe earth’s crust will always ensure it will remain expensive relative to
other materials and metals. This property has been instrumental in the
rise of gold as money because it ensured a relative stability of valuefor gold over time, regardless of global changes in monetary demandthrough countries going on or off the gold standard. This relativestability in turn solidified gold’s appeal as a monetary asset and ensured
demand for it, and can be understood as the real reason central banks
do not sell their gold reserves decades after their currencies stoppedbeing redeemable in it. Should central banks sell their gold reserves,the net effect will be that tons more gold will be utilized in industrialapplications over the coming few years, with a small impact on gold’sTrim Size: 6in x 9in Ammous c09.tex V1 - 03/05/2018 1:09pm Page 215 k

can print itself, and would lose an asset which will likely gain value overits own currency.

Should it achieve some sort of stability in value, Bitcoin would be
superior to using national currencies for global payment settlements, asis the case today, because national currencies fluctuate in value based on
each nation’s and government’s conditions, and their widespread adop-
tion as a global reserve currency results in an “exorbitant privilege” tothe issuing nation. An international settlement currency should be neu-tral to the monetary policy of different countries, which is why gold
played this role with excellence during the international gold standard.
Bitcoin would have an advantage over gold in playing this role becauseits settlement can be completed in minutes, and the authenticity of thetransactionscanbetriviallyverifiedbyanyonewithanInternetconnec-
tion, at virtually no cost. Gold, on the other hand, takes more time to
transport, and its clearance relies on varying degrees of trust in inter-mediaries responsible for settling it and transferring it. This might pre-serve gold’s monetary role for in-person cash transactions while Bitcoin

Bitcoin Questions
With the economic basics of the operation of Bitcoin
explained in Chapter 8, and the main potential use cases
of Bitcoin discussed in Chapter 9, a few of the most
salient questions surrounding Bitcoin’s operation are examined here.
Is Bitcoin Mining a Waste?
Anyone who joins the Bitcoin network generates a public address and a
private key . These are analogous to an email address and its password:
people can send you bitcoins to your public address while you use yourprivate key to send bitcoins from your balance. These addresses can also
be presented in Quick Response (QR) code format.

the network, it is inscribed onto the common ledger shared by all net-
work members, allowing all members to update the balance of the two
transacting members. While it is easy for any network member to ver-
ify the validity of a transaction, a system of voting based on giving each
member one vote could be gamed by a hacker creating a lot of nodes to
vote to validate their fraudulent transactions. Only by making accuracy
basedonCPUcyclesexpendedbymembers,inotherwords,employing
aproof-of-worksystem,canBitcoinsolvethedouble-spendingproblem
without a trusted third party.
In its essence, proof-of-work involves network members competing
to solve mathematical problems that are hard to solve but whose solu-
tion is easy to verify. All Bitcoin transactions verified in a ten-minute
interval are transcribed and grouped together into one block. Nodes
compete to solve the PoW math problems for a block of transactions,
and the first node to produce the correct solution broadcasts it to net-
work members, who can very quickly verify its correctness. Once the
validity of the transactions and PoW are verified by a majority of thenetwork nodes, a set quantity of bitcoin is issued to reward the node
that correctly solved the PoW. This is known as the block subsidy ,a n d
the process of generating the new coins has been referred to as mining,
because it is the only way that the supply of coins is increased, in the
samewaythatminingistheonlywaytoincreasethesupplyofgold.On
top of the block subsidy, the node that correctly solved the PoW also
gets the transaction fees included by senders. The sum of the transaction
fees and the block subsidy is the block reward .
Although solving these problems might initially seem a wasteful use
ofcomputingandelectricpower,proof-of-workisessentialtotheoper-
ation of Bitcoin.

cessing power to produce new bitcoins, PoW is the only method so far
1The question of whether Bitcoin wastes electricity is at its heart a misunderstanding of the fundamen-
tallysubjective nature of value. Electricity is generated worldwide in large quantities to satisfy the needsof consumers. The only judgment about whether this electricity has gone to waste or not lies withthe consumer who pays for it. People who are willing to pay the cost of the operation of the Bitcoinnetwork for their transactions are effectively financing this electricity consumption, which means theelectricity is being produced to satisfy consumer needs and has not been wasted.

PoW makes the cost of writing a block extremely high and the cost
of verifying its validity extremely low, almost eliminating the incen-tive for anyone to try to create invalid transactions. If they tried, theywouldbewastingelectricityandprocessingpowerwithoutreceivingthe
block reward. Bitcoin can thus be understood as a technology that con-
vertselectricitytotruthfulrecordsthroughtheexpenditureofprocessingpower.Those who expendthiselectricityare rewardedwiththe bitcoincurrency,andsotheyhaveastrongincentivetomaintainitsintegrity.As
a result of attaching a strong economic incentive for honesty, Bitcoin’s
ledger has been practically incorruptible for the period of its operationso far, with no example of a successful double-spend attack on a con-firmed transaction. This integrity of the bitcoin ledger of transactionsis achieved without having to rely on any single party being honest. By
relying entirely on verification, Bitcoin dooms fraudulent transactions
to failure and obviates the need for trust in anyone for transactions to becompleted.
For an attacker to try to insert fraudulent transactions into the
Bitcoin ledger, he would need to have a majority of the processing
power behind the network to accept his fraud. Honest nodes that are
part of the network would have no incentive to do so, because it wouldundermine the integrity of Bitcoin and devalue the rewards they arereceiving, wasting the electricity and resources they have expendedon it. So an attacker’s only hope would be to mobilize a quantity of
processing power that constitutes more than 50% of the network to
verify his fraud and build on it as if it were valid. Such a move couldhavebeenpossibleintheearlydaysofBitcoinwhenthetotalprocessingpower behind the network was very small. But because the economicvalue held in the network at the time was nonexistent or insignificant,Trim Size: 6in x 9in Ammous c10.tex V1 - 03/05/2018 1:09pm Page 220 k

no such attacks materialized. As the network continued to grow and
more members brought processing power to it, the cost to attack thenetwork rose.
The reward to nodes for verifying transactions has proven to be a
profitableuseofprocessingpower.InJanuary2017,theprocessingpowerbehind the Bitcoin network is equivalent to that of 2 trillion consumerlaptops. It is more than two million times larger than the processingpower of the world’s largest supercomputer, and more than 200,000
times larger than the world’s top 500 supercomputers combined. By
monetizing processing power directly, Bitcoin has become the largestsingle-purpose computer network in the world.
Another contributing factor in this growth in processing power is
thattheverificationoftransactionsandthesolvingofthePoWproblems
has moved from being conducted by personal computers to special-
ized processers built specifically to be optimally efficient at running theBitcoinsoftware.TheseApplicationSpecificIntegratedCircuits(ASICs)were first introduced in 2012, and their deployment has made adding
processing power to the Bitcoin network more efficient, because no
electricity is wasted on any irrelevant computing processes that wouldbe present in any other, non-Bitcoin-specific computing unit. A globaldistributed network of independent dedicated miners now protects theintegrity of the Bitcoin ledger. All of these miners have no conceivable
purpose but verifying Bitcoin transactions and solving proof-of-work.

In its early years, Bitcoin users would run nodes and use them to
carry out their own transactions and to verify each other’s transactions,making each node a wallet and a verifier/miner. But with time, these
functions have been separated. ASIC chips are now specialized only in
verifying transactions to receive reward coins (which is why they arecommonly referred to as miners). Node operators can now generateunlimited wallets, allowing businesses to offer convenient wallets forusers who can send and receive bitcoins without operating a node or
spending processing power on verifying transactions. This has moved
Bitcoin away from being a pure peer-to-peer network between identicalnodes, but the main functional importance of the decentralized and dis-tributed nature of the network has arguably remained intact, as a largenumber of nodes still exists and no single party is relied on to operate
the network. Further, specialized mining has allowed for the processing
power backing the network to grow to the astoundingly large size it hasreached.
In its early days, when the tokens had little or no value, the net-
work could have been conceivably hijacked and destroyed by attackers,
but as the network had little economic value, nobody seems to havebothered. As the economic value held on the network increased, theincentivetoattackthenetworkmayhaveincreased,butthecostofdoingsorosemuchmore,resultinginnoattacksmaterializing.Butperhapsthe

users can very easily leave it otherwise.

resistance of the code to change, combined with the intransigency ofthe monetary policy, are what has allowed Bitcoin to survive and growin value to the extent to which it has today. It is hard for people newTrim Size: 6in x 9in Ammous c10.tex V1 - 03/05/2018 1:09pm Page 222 k

Out of Control: Why Nobody Can Change Bitcoin
“The nature of Bitcoin is such that once version 0.1 was released, the
core design was set in stone for the rest of its lifetime.”
—Satoshi Nakamoto, 6/17/2010
Bitcoin’s resilience has so far not been restricted to successfully
repelling attacks; it has also ably resisted any attempt at changing it
or altering its characteristics. The true depth of this statement and its
implications has not yet been fully realized by most skeptics. If Bitcoin’scurrency were to be compared to a central bank, it would be theworld’s most independent central bank. If it were to be compared to a
nation-state, it would be the most sovereign nation-state in the world.
The sovereignty of Bitcoin is derived from the fact that, as far as anyonecan tell, the way its consensus rules operate makes it very resistant to
alteration by individuals. It is no exaggeration to say nobody controls
Bitcoin, and that the only option available to people is to use it as it isor not use it.
This immutability is not a feature of the Bitcoin software, which is
trivialtochange for anyone withcodingskills,but ratherisgrounded inthe economics of the currency and network, and stems from the diffi-

Nakamoto and Hal Finney and others had produced a working model
of the software in January 2009, the code has evolved significantly since
then through the contributions of hundreds of developers as chosenby thousands of users who run nodes. There is no central authority
that determines the evolution of the Bitcoin software and no single
programmer is able to dictate any outcome. The key to running animplementation that gets adopted has proven to be the adherence to
the parameters of the original design. To the extent that changes have
been made to the software, these changes can be best understood as
improvements to the way in which an individual node interacts with
the network, but not alterations to the Bitcoin network or its consensusrules. While it is outside the scope of the book to discuss which

parameters these are, suffice it to specify this criterion: a change that
puts the node who adopts it out of consensus with other nodes requiresall other nodes to update in order for the node initiating the change
to remain on the network. Should a number of nodes adopt the new
consensus rules, what emerges is referred to as a hard fork.
Bitcoin’s coders, then, for all their competence, cannot control
Bitcoin, and are only Bitcoin coders to the extent that they providenode operators with software the node operators want to adopt. But
codersaren’ttheonlyoneswhocannotcontrolBitcoin.Miners,too,for
all of the hashing power they can marshal, also cannot control Bitcoin.No matter how much hashing power is expended on processing blocksthat are invalid, they will not be validated by a majority of Bitcoinnodes. Therefore, if miners attempted to change the rules of the
network, the blocks they generate would simply be ignored by the
network members who operate the nodes, and they would be wastingtheir resources on solving proof-of-work problems without any reward.Miners are only Bitcoin miners to the extent that they produce blocks
with valid transactions according to the current consensus rules.
ItwouldbetemptingheretosaythatnodeoperatorscontrolBitcoin,
and that is true in an abstract collective manner. More realistically, nodeoperators can only control their own nodes and decide for themselveswhich network rules to join and which transactions they deem valid or
invalid. Nodes are severely restricted in their choice of consensus rules
because if they enforced rules inconsistent with the consensus of thenetwork, their transactions would be rejected. Each node has a strongincentive to maintain network consensus rules and to stay compatiblewithnodesontheseconsensusrules.Eachindividualnodeispowerlessto
forceothernodestochangetheircode,andthatcreatesastrongcollective
bias to remain on the current consensus rules.
In conclusion, the Bitcoin coders face a strong incentive to abide

Bitcoinhasresistedallattemptstochangeitsignificantlysofar.Thecoor-
dination problem of organizing a simultaneous shift among people withadversarial interests, many of whom are strongly vested in the notion of
immutability for its own sake, is likely intractable barring any pressing
reason for people to move away from current implementations.
For instance, an edit to increase the issuance rate of the currency
to raise the coins that reward miners might appeal to miners, but itwould not appeal to current holders, and so they are unlikely to go
with such a proposal. Similarly, an edit to increase the size of the Bit-
coin network blocks would likely benefit miners by allowing them torun more transactions per block and possibly collect more transactionfees to maximize returnon their investment in their mining equipment.But it would likely not appeal to long-term holders of Bitcoin, who
would worry that larger blocks would cause the size of the blockchain
togrowmuchbigger,andthusmakerunningafullnodemoreexpensive,thereby dropping the number of nodes in the network, making the net-work more centralized and thus more vulnerable to attack. The coders
who develop software to run Bitcoin nodes are powerless to impose
changes on anybody; all they can do is propose code, and users are freeto download whichever code and version they like. Any code that iscompatible with the existing implementations will be far more likely tobe downloaded than any code that is not compatible, because the latter
would only succeed if the overwhelming majority of the network also
ran it.
As a result, Bitcoin exhibits extremely strong status-quo bias. Only
minor and uncontroversial changes to the code have been implementedsofar,andeveryattempttoalterthenetworksignificantlyhasendedwith
resounding failure, to the delight of long-term Bitcoin stalwarts who
like nothing more about their currency than its immutability and resis-tance to change. The highest-profile of these attempts have concernedincreasing the size of individual blocks to increase transaction through-put. Several projects have gathered the names of some very prominent
and old-time Bitcoiners, and spent a lot on trying to gain publicity for
the coin. Gavin Andresen, who was one of the faces most publicly asso-ciated with Bitcoin, has pushed very aggressively for several attempts tofork Bitcoin into having bigger blocks, along with many stakeholders,including some skilled developers and deep-pocketed entrepreneurs.Trim Size: 6in x 9in Ammous c10.tex V1 - 03/05/2018 1:09pm Page 228 k

Initially, Bitcoin XT was proposed by Andresen and a developer by
the name of Mike Hearn in June 2015, aiming at increasing the size ofablockfrom1MBto8MB.Butthemajorityofnodesrefusedtoupdate
to their software and preferred to stay on the 1-megabyte blocks. Hearn
was then hired by a “blockchain consortium of financial institutions” tobring blockchain technology to the financial markets, and published ablogposttocoincidewithaglowingprofileofhiminthe New York Times
which hailed him as desperately trying to save Bitcoin while painting
Bitcoinasnowbeingdoomedtofailure.Hearnproclaimed“theresolu-
tionoftheBitcoinexperiment”,citingthelackofgrowthintransactioncapacityasalethalroadblocktoBitcoin’ssuccessandannouncinghehadsold all his coins. The bitcoin price on that day was around $350. Overthe following two years, the price was to increase more than forty-fold
while the “blockchain consortium” he joined is yet to produce any
actual products.
Undeterred, Gavin Andresen immediately proposed a new attempt
to fork Bitcoin under the name of “Bitcoin Classic,” which would have
raised the blocksize to 8 megabytes. This attempt fared no better, and
by March 2016 the number of nodes supporting it began to fizzle. Yet,supporters of increasing the blocksize regrouped into Bitcoin Unlim-ited in 2017, an even wider coalition that included the largest makerof Bitcoin mining chips, as well as a wealthy individual who controls
the bitcoin.com domain name and has spent enormous resources try-
ing to promote larger blocks. A lot of media hype was generated andthe sense of crisis was palpable to many who follow Bitcoin news onmainstream media and social media; yet the reality remained that nofork was attempted, as the majority of nodes continued to run on the
1MB-compatible implementations.
Finally, in August 2017, a group of programmers proposed a new
forkofBitcoinunderthenameof“BitcoinCash,”whichincludedmanyof the earlier advocates of increasing the block size. The fate of BitcoinCash is a vivid illustration of the problems with a Bitcoin fork that does
not have consensus support. Because a majority chose to stay with the
original chain, and the economic infrastructure of exchanges and busi-nesses supporting Bitcoin is still largely focused on the original Bitcoin,thishaskeptthevalueofBitcoin’scoinsmuchhigherthanthatofBitcoinCash, and the price of Bitcoin Cash continued to drop until it hit a lowTrim Size: 6in x 9in Ammous c10.tex V1 - 03/05/2018 1:09pm Page 229 k

hashing algorithm as Bitcoin, miners can utilize their processing power
on both chains and receive rewards in both. But because Bitcoin’s coinsare far more valuable than Bitcoin Cash, the processing power behindBitcoin remains far higher than that of Bitcoin Cash, and Bitcoin min-ers can shift to Bitcoin Cash any time the rewards get high. This leaves
Bitcoin Cash in an unfortunate dilemma: if the mining difficulty is too
high,thentherewillbealongdelayforblockstobeproducedandtrans-actions to process. But if the difficulty is set too low, the coin is minedvery quickly and the supply increases quickly. This increases the supplyoftheBitcoinCashcoinsfasterthantheBitcoinchain,andwouldleadto
the coin reward for Bitcoin Cash running out very quickly, thus reduc-
ing the incentive for future miners to mine it. Most likely, this will haveto lead to a hard fork that adjusts the supply growth to continue offer-ing rewards to miners. This problem is unique to a chain breaking off
from Bitcoin, but was never true for Bitcoin itself. Bitcoin mining was
alwaysutilizingthelargestamountofprocessingpowerforitsalgorithm,and the increase in processing power was always incremental as minersemployed more mining capacity. But with a coin that breaks off fromBitcoin, the lower value of the coin and the lower difficulty makes the
coin constantly vulnerable for quick mining by the much larger mining
capacity of the more valuable chain.
After the failure of this fork to challenge Bitcoin’s prime position,
another attempt at a fork to double the blocksize, negotiated betweenvarious startups active in the Bitcoin economy, was canceled in
mid-November as its promoters realized they were highly unlikely to
achieve consensus for their move and would instead most likely end upwith another coin and network. Bitcoin stalwarts have learned to shrugat such attempts, realizing that no matter how much hype is generated,any attempt to change the consensus rules of Bitcoin will lead to the
generation of yet another Bitcoin copycat, like the altcoins which
copy Bitcoin’s incidental details but do not have its only importantcharacteristic: immutability.

Antifragility
BitcoinisanembodimentofNassimTaleb’sideaof antifragility ,whichhe
defines as gaining from adversity and disorder. Bitcoin is not just robustto attack, but it can be said to be antifragile on both a technical andeconomic level. While attempts to kill Bitcoin have so far failed, manyof them have made it stronger by ending up allowing coders to identify
weaknesses and patch them up. Further, every thwarted attack on the
network is a notch on its belt, another testament and advertisement toparticipants and outsiders of the security of the network.

In turn, the continued success of Bitcoin rewards these coders finan-
cially and thus allows them to dedicate more time and effort to themaintenance of Bitcoin. Some of the prominent developers working
on maintaining Bitcoin have become wealthy enough from investing in
Bitcoin that they can make it their prime occupation without receivingpay from anyone.
In terms of media coverage, Bitcoin appears to be a good embodi-
mentoftheadage“allpublicityisgoodpublicity.”Asanewtechnology

sianfaithintheimportanceofanelasticsupplyofmoney—andrefusedtoconsider the possibility they might be wrong. Instead, they concludedthat it must be Bitcoin whose existence is wrong, and therefore they
predicted it would die soon. Others believed strongly in the need for
Bitcoin to change to maintain its success, and when they failed to getit to change in the way they desired, they concluded it must die. Thesepeople’sattacksonBitcoinledthemtowriteaboutitandbringittotheattention of ever-wider audiences. The more obituaries intensified, the
more its processing power, transactions, and market value grew. Many
Bitcoiners, this author included, only came around to appreciating theimportance of Bitcoin by noticing how many times it had been writtenoff,andhowitcontinuedtooperatesuccessfully.TheBitcoinobituarieswere powerless to stop it, but they seem to have helped it gain more
publicity and awaken the public’s curiosity to the fact that it continues
to operate in spite of all the hostility and bad press it gets.

it is far more than a currency for crime, and in the process it benefited

Another example of Bitcoin’s antifragility came in September 2017,
after the Chinese government announced the closure of all Chineseexchanges that traded Bitcoin. Whereas the initial reaction was one ofpanic that saw the price drop by around 40%, it was only a matter ofhours before the price started recovering, and within a few months the
pricehadmorethandoubledfromwhereitwasbeforethegovernment’s

While banning exchanges from trading Bitcoin could be viewed asan impediment to Bitcoin’s adoption through a reduction in its liquid-ity, it seems to have only served to reinforce Bitcoin’s value proposition.More transactions started happening off exchanges in China, with vol-ume on websites like localbitcoins.com exploding. It may just be that
the suspension of trading in China caused the opposite of the intended
effect, as it drove Chinese to hold onto their Bitcoin for the long termrather than trade it for the short term.
Can Bitcoin Scale?
At the time of writing, one of the most high-profile debates surround-
ing Bitcoin concerns the question of scaling, or increasing the trans-
action capacity. Bitcoin’s 1-megabyte blocks mean that the capacity fortransactions as it stands is around less than 500,000 transactions per day.Bitcoinhasalreadyapproachedtheselevelsoftransactions,andasaresult,transaction fees have risen significantly over the past few months. Theimplementation of a technology called Segwit could result in a quadru-
plingofthisdailycapacity,butitisnonethelessbecomingclearthatthere
will be a hard limit to how many transactions can be processed over theBitcoin blockchain, due to the decentralized and distributed nature ofBitcoin. Each Bitcoin transaction is recorded with all network nodes,who are all required to keep a copy of the entire ledger of all transac-tions. This necessarily means that the cost of recording transactions will
be far higher than for any centralized solution which only needs oneTrim Size: 6in x 9in Ammous c10.tex V1 - 03/05/2018 1:09pm Page 233 k

tems are all centralized for a good reason: it is cheaper to keep a centralrecord than to keep several distributed records and have to worry about
themupdatinginsync,aprocesswhichsofarcanonlybeachievedusing
Bitcoin proof-of-work.
Centralized payment solutions, such as Visa or MasterCard, employ
one centralized ledger to which all transactions are committed, as wellas a backup that is entirely separate. Visa can process around 3,200
transactions per second, or 100.8 billion transactions per year.

thatVisaprocesses,eachblockwouldneedtobearound800megabytes,
meaning every ten minutes, each Bitcoin node would need to add800 megabytes of data. In a year, each Bitcoin node would add around42 terabytes of data, or 42,000 gigabytes, to its blockchain. Such anumber is completely outside the realm of possible processing power of
commercially available computers now or in the foreseeable future. The
average consumer computer, or the average external hard drive, has acapacity in the order of 1 terabyte, about a week’s worth of transactionsat Visa volumes. For some perspective, it is worth examining the sort ofcomputinginfrastructurethatVisaemploystoprocessthesetransactions.
In 2013, a report showed that Visa owns a data center described as
a “digital Fort Knox” containing 376 servers, 277 switches, 85 routers,and 42 firewalls.
6Granted, Visa’s centralized system is a single point of
failure, and so it employs very large amounts of redundancy and sparecapacity to protect from unforeseen circumstances, whereas in the case
of Bitcoin, the presence of many nodes would make each one of them
non-critical, and so requiring less security and capacity. Nonetheless, anode that can add 42 terabytes of data every year would require a veryexpensive computer, and the network bandwidth required to process all

There are only a handful of such centers in existence worldwide:
those employed by Visa, MasterCard, and a few other payment pro-
cessors. Should Bitcoin attempt to process such a capacity, it could notpossibly compete with these centralized solutions by having thousandsof distributed centers on a similar scale; it would have to become cen-tralized and employ only a few such data centers. For Bitcoin to remain
distributed, each node on the network must cost something reasonable

It is inconceivable that Bitcoin could run the same scale of transac-
tions on-chain that a centralized system can support. This explains why
transaction costs are rising, and in most likelihood, will continue to riseif the network continues to grow. The biggest scope for scaling Bitcointransactions will likely come off-chain, where many simpler technolo-
giescanbeusedforsmallandunimportantpayments.Thisensuresthere
can be no compromise of Bitcoin’s two most significant properties forwhichusingextensiveprocessingpowerisjustified:digitalsoundmoneyand digital cash. There are no alternative technologies that can offerthesetwofunctions,buttherearemanytechnologiesthatcanoffersmall
payments and consumer spending at low costs, and the technology for
these choices is very simple to implement relatively reliably with cur-rent banking technologies. Bitcoin mass use for merchant payments isnot even very feasible given that it takes anywhere from 1 to 12 minutesfor a transaction to receive its first confirmation. Merchants and cus-
tomers cannot wait that long on payments, and even though the risk of
adouble-spendattackisnotsignificantenoughforonesmallpayment,itis significant enough for merchants who receive large numbers of trans-actions as in the example of the attack on Betcoin Dice, discussed laterin the section on attacks on Bitcoin.
For people who want to use bitcoin as a digital long-term store
of value, or for people who want to carry out important transactionswithout having to go through a repressive government, the high trans-action fees are a price well worth paying.

fee is worth paying for it. And for transactions that cannot be carried
out through the regular banking system, such as people trying to gettheir money out of a country suffering inflation and capital controls,
Bitcoin’s high transaction fees will be a price well worth paying. Even
at current low levels of adoption, the demand for digital cash and dig-ital sound money has already raised transaction fees to the point wherethey cannot compete with centralized solutions like PayPal and creditcards for small payments. This has not stalled Bitcoin’s growth, how-
ever, which indicates that the market demand for Bitcoin is driven by
its use as a digital cash and digital store of value, rather than small digitalpayments.
If Bitcoin’s popularity continues to grow, there are some potential
scaling solutions that do not involve creating any changes to the struc-
ture of Bitcoin, but which take advantage of the way transactions are
structured to increase the number of payments possible. Each Bitcointransaction can contain several inputs and outputs, and using a tech-nique called CoinJoin, several payments can be grouped together into
one transaction, allowing several inputs and outputs for only a fraction
of the space that would have been needed otherwise. This could poten-tiallyraisethetransactionvolumeofBitcointothemillionsofpaymentsper day, and as the transaction costs rise higher, this is more and morelikely to become a popular option.

is usually dwarfed by the commission and the premium placed by the
sellers. For people looking to escape capital controls or send money tocountries facing economic difficulties, the transaction fee is well worth
paying considering Bitcoin is the only alternative. As Bitcoin adoption
spreads, and transaction fees rise high enough that they will matter tothepeoplepayingthem,therewillbeeconomicpressuretoutilizemoreof the above scaling solutions which can increase transaction capacitywithout making changes that compromise the rules of the network and
force a chain split.
Beyond these possibilities, the majority of Bitcoin transactions
today are already carried out off-chain, and only settled on-chain.Bitcoin-based businesses, such as exchanges, casinos, or gamingwebsites, will only use Bitcoin’s blockchain for customer deposits and
withdrawals, but within their platforms, all transactions are recorded on
their local databases, denominated in Bitcoin. It is not possible to makeaccurate estimates of the number of these transactions due to the verylarge number of businesses, the lack of public data on the transactions
taking place in their proprietary platforms, and the quickly shifting
dynamics of the Bitcoin economy, but a conservative estimate wouldput them as being more than 10 times the number of transactionscarriedoutontheBitcoinblockchain.Ineffect,Bitcoinisalreadybeingused as a reserve asset in the majority of the transactions in the Bitcoin
economy. Should Bitcoin’s growth continue it is only natural to see
the number of off-chain transactions increase faster than the on-chaintransactions.
Such an analysis may contradict the rhetoric that accompanied the
rise of Bitcoin, which promotes Bitcoin as putting an end to banks and
banking. The idea that millions, let alone billions, could use the Bitcoin
network directly for carrying out their every transaction is unrealistic asit would entail that every network member needs to be recording everyothermember’stransactions.Asthenumbersgrow,theserecordsbecomelargerandconstituteasignificantcomputingburden.Ontheotherhand,
Bitcoin’s unique properties as a store of value are likely to continue

Anotherimportantreasonwhybankingasaninstitutionisnotgoing
away is the convenience of banking custody. While many Bitcoin puristsvalue the freedom accorded to them by being able to hold their own
moneyandnotrelyonafinancialinstitutiontoaccessit,thevastmajority
of people would not want this freedom and prefer to not have theirmoney under their responsibility for fear of theft or abduction. In themidst of the very common anti-bank rhetoric that is popular these days,particularly in Bitcoin circles, it is easy to forget that deposit banking
is a legitimate business which people have demanded for hundreds of
years around the world. People have happily paid to have their moneystored safely so they only need to carry a small amount of money onthem and face little risk of loss. In turn, the widespread use of bankingcardsinsteadofcashallowspeopletocarrysmallsumsofmoneyonthem

Even if it were possible for Bitcoin’s network to support billions

While the term cashhas come to denote the money used for small
consumer transactions today, the original meaning of the term refersto money that is a bearer instrument, whose value can be transferreddirectly without resort to settlement by, or liability of, third parties.
In the nineteenth century, the term cashreferred to central bank gold
reserves, and cash settlement was the transfer of physical gold betweenbanks. If this analysis is correct, and Bitcoin continues to grow in valueand off-chain transactions while on-chain transactions do not grow asmuch, Bitcoin would be better understood as cash in the old meaningof the term, similar to gold cash reserves, rather than the modern term
for cash as paper money for small transactions.
In conclusion, there are many possibilities for increasing the num-
ber of bitcoin transactions without having to alter the architecture ofBitcoin as it is, and without requiring all current node operators toupgrade simultaneously.

Is Bitcoin for Criminals?
One of the very common misconceptions about Bitcoin from itsinception is that it would make a great currency for criminals andterrorists. A long list of press articles have been published with unsub-
stantiated claims that terrorists or criminal gangs are using Bitcoin forTrim Size: 6in x 9in Ammous c10.tex V1 - 03/05/2018 1:09pm Page 239 k

they have imprinted the idea into the minds of many people, includingmisguided criminals.
The reality is that Bitcoin’s ledger is globally accessible and
immutable. It will carry the record of every transaction for as long asBitcoin is still operational. It is inaccurate to really say Bitcoin is anony-mous,asitisratherpseudonymous.Itispossible,thoughnotguaranteed,to establish links between real-life identities and Bitcoin addresses,
thus allowing the full tracking of all transactions by an address once its
identity is established. When it comes to anonymity, it is useful to thinkof Bitcoin as being as anonymous as the Internet: it depends on howwell you hide, and how well the others look. Yet Bitcoin’s blockchainmakes hiding that much more difficult on the Web. It is easy to disposeof a device, email address, or IP address and never use it again, but it isharder to completely erase the trail of funds to one bitcoin address. Byits very nature, Bitcoin’s blockchain structure is not ideal for privacy.
Allofthismeansthatforanycrimethatactuallyhasavictim,itwould
be inadvisable for the criminal to use Bitcoin. Its pseudonymous nature
meansthataddressescouldbelinkedtoreal-worldidentities,evenmany
years after the crime is committed. The police, or the victims and anyinvestigatorstheyhire,mightwellbeabletofindalinktotheidentityofthe criminal, even after many years.

Bitcoin is a technology for money, and money is something that
can be used by criminals at all times. Any form of money can be usedby criminals or to facilitate crime, but Bitcoin’s permanent ledgermakes it particularly unsuited to crimes with victims likely to try to
investigate. Bitcoin can be useful in facilitating “victimless crimes,”
where the absence of the victim will mean nobody trying to establishthe identity of the “criminal.” In reality, and once one overcomes thepropaganda of the twentieth-century state, there is no such thing as avictimless crime. If an action has no victims, it is no crime, regardlessof what some self-important voters or bureaucrats would like to believe

about their prerogative to legislate morality for others. For these illegal
but perfectly moral actions, Bitcoin could be useful because there areno victims to try to hunt down the perpetrator. The harmless activity
carried out shows up on the blockchain as an individual transaction
which could have a multitude of causes. So one can expect thatvictimless crimes, such as online gambling and evading capital controls,would use Bitcoin, but murder and terrorism would more likely not.Drug dealing seems to happen on the Bitcoin blockchain, though
that is likely more down to addicts’ cravings than sound judgment, as
evidenced by the large number of Bitcoin drug purchasers that havebeen identified by law enforcement. While statistics on this matter arevery hard to find, I would not be surprised to find buying drugs withBitcoin is far more dangerous than with physical government money.
In other words, Bitcoin will likely increase individuals’ freedom
while not necessarily making it easier for them to commit crimes. It isnot a tool to be feared, but one to be embraced as an integral part of apeaceful and prosperous future.

grow as an industry. In other words, Bitcoin allows for the monetiz-ing of the computer security market. While hackers can initially benefitfrom this, in the long run, productive businesses will command the bestsecurity resources.Trim Size: 6in x 9in Ammous c10.tex V1 - 03/05/2018 1:09pm Page 241 k

Once Bitcoin’s operation is understood, it becomesclear that “hacking” it is not a straightforward task. There are severalother possible threats to Bitcoin.

8Thissectionexaminesonlysome
of the more high-profile threats and the ones most relevant to the focusof this book on Bitcoin as sound money.
Hacking
Bitcoin’s resistance to attack is rooted in three properties: its barebonessimplicity, the vast processing power that does nothing but ensure the
safety of this very simple design, and the distributed nodes which need
to achieve consensus on any change for it to take effect. Imagine thedigital equivalent of placing the entirety of the U.S. military’s infantryand equipment around a school playground to protect it from invasionand you begin to get an idea of how overly fortified Bitcoin is.
Bitcoinisatitsessencealedgerofownershipofvirtualcoins.There
are only 21 million of these coins, and a few million addresses that own
them, and every day no more than 500,000 transactions move some of
these coins around. The computing power necessary to operate such asystemisminuscule.Alaptopfor$100coulddoitwhilealsosurfingtheWeb. But the reason Bitcoin is not run on one laptop is that such anarrangement would require trust in the owner of the laptop while alsobeing a relatively simple target for hacking.

Bitcoin, on the other hand, takes an entirely different approach to com-
putersecurity:itdoesnotbothertosecureanyofitscomputersindividu-ally,andoperatesundertheworkingassumptionthatallcomputernodes
are hostile attackers. Instead of establishing trust in any network mem-
ber, Bitcoin verifies everything they do. That process of verification,through proof-of-work, is what consumes large amounts of processing
power,andithasprovenveryeffectivebecauseitmakesBitcoinsecurity
dependentonbruteprocessingpower,andassuch,invulnerabletoprob-lems of access or credentials. If everyone is assumed dishonest, everyone
mustpayalargecosttocommittransactionstothecommonrecord,and
everyone will lose these costs if their fraud is detected. The economicincentives make dishonesty extremely expensive and highly unlikely to
succeed.
TohackBitcoin,inthesenseofcorruptingtheledgeroftransactions
tofraudulentlymove coins to a specificaccount,or to makeit unusable,would require a node to post an invalid block to the blockchain, and
the network to adopt it and continue to build on it. Because nodes have
a very low cost of detecting fraud, while the cost of adding a block oftransactionsishighandcontinuouslyrising,andbecausethemajorityof
nodes in the network have an interest in Bitcoin surviving, this battle is
unlikely to be won by attackers, and continues to get harder as the costof adding blocks gets higher.
At the heart of Bitcoin’s design there is a fundamental asymmetry
betweenthecostofcommittinganewblockoftransactionsandthecostof verifying the validity of these transactions. This means while forging
the record is technically possible, the economic incentives are highly
stacked against it. The ledger of transactions as a result constitutes anundisputable record of valid transactions so far.

solve proof-of-work problems quickly, he could spend a bitcoin on a
public chain that receives confirmations while mining another fork ofthe blockchain with another transaction of the same bitcoin to another
address, belonging to the attacker. The recipient of the first transaction
receives confirmations, but the attacker will attempt to use his process-ing power to make the second chain longer. If he succeeds in makingthe second chain longer than the first one, the attack succeeds, and therecipient of the first transaction will find the coins they received vanish.
The more hashrate the attacker is able to command, the more likely
he is to make the fraudulent chain longer than the public one, and thenreverse his transaction and profit. While this may sound simple in prin-ciple,inpracticeithasbeenmuchharder.Thelongertherecipientwaitsfor confirmation, the less likely it is that the attacker can succeed. If the
recipient is willing to wait for six confirmations, the probability of an
attack succeeding shrinks infinitely low.
In theory, the 51% percent attack is very feasible technically. But in
practice, the economic incentives are heavily aligned against it. A miner
who successfully executes a 51% attack would severely undermine the
economicincentivesforanyonetouseBitcoin,andwiththatthedemandfor Bitcoin tokens. As Bitcoin mining has grown to become a heavilycapital-intensive industry with large investments dedicated to produc-ing coins, miners have grown to have a vested long-term interest in
the integrity of the network, as the value of their rewards depends on
it. There have been no successful double-spend attacks on any Bitcointransactions that have been confirmed at least once.
Theclosestthingtoasuccessfuldouble-spendattackthatBitcoinhas
witnessed was in 2013, when a Bitcoin betting site called Betcoin Dice
had a sum in the range of 1,000 bitcoins (valued at around $100,000 at
the time) stolen from it through double-spend attacks utilizing signif-icant mining resources. That attack, however, only succeeded becauseBetcoin Dice was accepting transactions with zero confirmations, mak-ingthe cost ofattackrelativelylow.Had theyacceptedtransactions with
oneconfirmation,itwouldhavebeenmuchhardertopullofftheattack.
This is another reason Bitcoin’s blockchain is not ideal for mass con-sumer payments: it takes somewhere in the range of 1 to 12 minutes fora new block to be generated to produce one confirmation for a trans-action.

ofapprovingpaymentswithzeroconfirmations,itconstitutesalucrative
target for coordinated double-spend attacks that utilize heavy miningresources.
In conclusion, a 51% attack is theoretically possible to execute if the

members that have waited for at least one confirmation.
A 51% attack would likely not be successful if done for a profit
motive, but such an attack could also be carried out with no profitmotive, but with the intention of destroying Bitcoin. A governmentor private entity could decide to acquire Bitcoin mining capacity to
commandeer a majority of the Bitcoin network and then proceed to
usethathashratetolaunchcontinuousdouble-spendattacks,defraudingmany users and destroying confidence in the safety of the network. Yetthe economic nature of mining is heavily stacked against this scenario
materializing. Processing power is a highly competitive global market,
and Bitcoin mining is one of the largest, most profitable, and fastestgrowing uses of processing power in the world. An attacker may lookat the cost of commandeering 51% of current hashing power and bewilling to dedicate that cost to purchasing the hardware necessary for
this. But if such an enormous amount of resources were mobilized to
buy Bitcoin mining equipment, it would simply lead to a sharp rise inthe price of this equipment, which would reward current miners andallow them to invest more heavily in buying more mining equipment.It would also lead to heavier capital investment in the production of
miningpowerbyminingproducers,whichwouldbringthecostofpro-
cessing power down and allow the faster growth of Bitcoin’s hashrate.As an outsider entering the market, the attacker is at a constant disad-vantage as his own purchasing of mining equipment leads to the fastergrowth of the mining processing power not controlled by him. In turn,

An attacker, particularly a state, could attempt to attack Bitcoin
through taking control of existing mining infrastructure and using it
unprofitably in order to undermine the safety of the network. The
fact that Bitcoin mining is widely distributed geographically makes thisa challenging prospect that would require collaboration from various
governments worldwide. A better way to implement this might be not
through physically taking over mining equipment but commandeeringit through hardware backdoors.
Hardware Backdoors
Another possibility for disrupting or destroying the Bitcoin network isthrough corrupting hardware that runs bitcoin software to be accessibleby outside parties. Nodes that perform mining could, for example, befitted with undetectable malware that allows outsiders to commandeer
the hardware. This equipment could then be deactivated or remotely
controlled at a time when a 51% attack is launched.
Another example would be through spying technology installed
on user computers allowing access to users’ bitcoins by accessing their
private keys. Such attacks on a mass scale could severely undermineconfidence in Bitcoin as an asset and demand for it.
Both types of attack are feasible technically, and unlike the previous
two kinds of attacks, they do not have to succeed entirely in order tocreate enough confusion to hurt Bitcoin’s reputation and demand. Such
anattackonminingequipmentismorelikelytosucceedgiventhatthere
are only a few manufacturers of mining equipment, and this constitutesoneofBitcoin’smostcriticalpointsoffailure.However,asBitcoinmin-

manufacture its equipment, which would reduce the disastrous impacton the network from the compromise of one manufacturer’s operations.

to consumers shifting to other producers. Further, users can generatethe private keys to their addresses on offline computers which they will

their addresses and private keys on offline computers which are then
immediately destroyed. Coins stored on these virtual private keys will
survive any kind of attack on the network.
Particularly important defenses against these kinds of attacks are
Bitcoiners’ anarchist and cypherpunk tendencies, which lead them to
believe much more in verification than trust. Bitcoiners are generally
far more technically competent than the average population, and theyare very meticulous about examining the hardware and software they
utilize. The open source peer review culture also acts as a significant
defense against these sorts of attacks. Given the distributed nature of thenetwork, it is far more likely that such attacks could cause significant
costs and losses to individuals, and perhaps even systemic disruptions of

that the economic incentives of Bitcoin are what make it valuable, not
any type of hardware. Any individual piece of equipment is dispensableto the operation of Bitcoin and can be replaced with other equipment.Nonetheless, Bitcoin’s survival and robustness will be enhanced if it can
diversify its hardware providers to not make any of them systemically
important.
Internet and Infrastructure Attacks
OneofthemostcommonlyheldmisconceptionsaboutBitcoinisthatit
can be shut down by shutting down important communications infras-
tructure on which Bitcoin relies, or shutting down the Internet. Theproblem with these scenarios is that they misunderstand Bitcoin as if it
is a network in the traditional sense of dedicated hardware and infras-

is really only about transmitting 1 megabyte of data every ten minutes.Therearecountlesswiredandwirelesstechnologiesforthetransmission

working to connectto the network. In order to create a world in whichno Bitcoin user is able to connect to other users, the kind of damage
that would be needed to be done to the world’s information, data, and
connectivity infrastructure would be absolutely devastating. The life ofmodernsocietydependstoaverylargedegreeonconnectivity,andmany

many people, for any force to be able to make them all stop functioning
simultaneously. The only conceivable scenario where this could hap-pen would be through the sort of apocalyptic scenario after which there
would be nobody left to even wonder if Bitcoin is operational or not.
Of all the threats that are often mentioned against Bitcoin, I find this tobe the least credible or meaningful.
Rise in Cost of Nodes and Drop in Their Numbers
Rather than imagining futuristic sci-fi scenarios involving the destruc-tion of humanity’s telecommunication infrastructure in a futile attemptat eradicating a software program, there are far more realistic threats to
Bitcoin grounded in the fundamentals of its design. Bitcoin’s property
as hard money whose supply cannot be tampered with, and as uncen-sorable digital cash without the possibility for third-party intervention,
is dependent upon the consensus rules of the network remaining very
hard to change, especially the money supply. What achieves this stablestatus quo, as discussed earlier, is that it is a highly risky and likely nega-
tive move for a network member to move out of the current consensusTrim Size: 6in x 9in Ammous c10.tex V1 - 03/05/2018 1:09pm Page 248 k

k248 THE BITCOIN STANDARD
rules if the other members of the network do not also move to the new
consensus rules. But what keeps that move highly risky and unlikely
is that the number of nodes running the software is large enough that
coordinationbetweenthemisnotpractical.ShouldthecostofrunningaBitcoinnodeincreasesignificantly,itwouldmakerunninganodeharder
formoreandmoreusers,andasaresultitwoulddecreasethenumberof
nodes on the network. A network with a few dozen nodes stops beingan effectively decentralized network as it becomes very possible for the
few nodes that operate it to collude to alter the rules of the network to
their own benefit, or even to sabotage it.
This remains in my opinion the most serious technical threat to
Bitcoin in the medium and long term. As it stands, the main constraint
on individuals being able to run their own nodes is the Internet con-nection bandwidth. As blocks remain under 1 megabyte, this should be
generally manageable. A hard fork that increases the size of the block
wouldcauseariseinthecostofrunninganodeandleadtoareductioninthenumberofoperationalnodes.Andjustlikewiththepreviousthreats,while this is certainly technically possible, it remains unlikely to mate-
rialize because the economic incentives of the system militate against
it, as evidenced by the widespread rejection of attempts to increase theblocksize so far.
The Breaking of the SHA-256 Hashing Algorithm
The SHA-256 hashing function is an integral part of the operation ofthe Bitcoin system. Briefly, hashing is a process that takes any streamof data as an input and transforms it into a dataset of fixed size (known
as a hash) using a nonreversible mathematical formula. In other words,
it is trivial to use this function to generate a hash for any piece of data,but it is not possible to determine the original string of data from the
hash.Withimprovementsinprocessingpower,itmightbecomepossible
forcomputerstoreverse-calculatethesehashingfunctions,whichwouldrender all Bitcoin addresses vulnerable to theft.
It is not possible to ascertain if and when such a scenario might
unfold,butifitdoes,itwouldconstituteaveryserioustechnicalthreattoBitcoin. The technical fix to counter this is to switch to a stronger form

most of the nodes of the network to abandon the old consensus rules
for a new set of rules with a new hashing function. All of the problems
previously discussed in the difficulty of coordinating a fork apply here,
but this time, because the threat is real, and any Bitcoin holder whochoosestostayontheoldimplementationwillbevulnerabletohacking,
itislikelythatanoverwhelmingmajorityofuserswilltakepartinahard
fork.Theonlyinterestingquestionthatremainsiswhetherthishardforkwill be orderly and witness all users migrate to the same chain, or if
it will lead to the chain splitting into several branches using different
encryption methods. While it is certainly possible that the SHA-256encryption may be broken, the economic incentives of network users
are to switch from it to a stronger algorithm, and to switch together to
one algorithm.
A Return to Sound Money
While most discussions of how Bitcoin could fail or get destroyed focuson technical attacks, a far more promising way of attacking Bitcoin is
through undermining the economic incentives to its use. To attempt to
attack or destroy Bitcoin in any of the ways mentioned earlier is highlyunlikelytosucceedbecauseitconflictswiththeeconomicincentivesthat
drive the use of Bitcoin. The situation is analogous to trying to ban the
wheeloraknife.Aslongasthetechnologyisusefulforpeople,attemptsat banning it will fail as people will continue to find ways of utilizing
it, legally or not. The only way that a technology can be stopped is not
by banning it, but by inventing a better replacement or by obviating theneed for its use. The typewriter could never be banned or legislated out
of existence, but the rise of the PC did effectively kill it.
The demand for Bitcoin stems from the need of individuals all over
the world to carry out transactions that bypass political controls and to
have an inflation-resistant store of value. For as long as political authori-
tiesimposerestrictionsandlimitationsonindividualstransferringmoney,and for as long as government money is easy money whose supply can
be easily expanded according to the whims of politicians, demand for
Bitcoinwillcontinuetoexist,anditsdiminishingsupplygrowthislikelyto lead to its value appreciating over time, thus attracting ever-larger
numbers of people to use it as a store of value.Trim Size: 6in x 9in Ammous c10.tex V1 - 03/05/2018 1:09pm Page 250 k

k250 THE BITCOIN STANDARD
Hypothetically, if the entire world’s banking and monetary systems
were replaced with those of the gold standard in the late nineteenthcentury, where individual freedom and hard money were paramount,
the demand for Bitcoin would likely subside significantly. It might just
be the case that such a move would cause a large enough reductionin demand for Bitcoin that brings its price significantly down, hurtingcurrent holders significantly, increasing the volatility of the currency,and setting it back many years. With the increased volatility and the
availability of a reliable and relatively stable hard-money international
monetarystandard,theincentiveforusingBitcoindropssignificantly.Ina world in which governments’ restrictions and inflationary tendenciesare disciplined by the gold standard, it might just be the case that gold’sfirst-moveradvantageandrelativepurchasingpowerstabilitywouldcon-
stitute an insurmountable hurdle for Bitcoin to overcome, by depriving
Bitcoin of the fast growth in users and thus preventing it from reachinga large enough size with any semblance of stability in price.
In practice, however, the possibility of a global return to sound
money and liberal government is extremely unlikely as these concepts
arelargelyalientothevastmajorityofpoliticiansandvotersworldwide,who have been reared for generations to understand governmentcontrol of money and morality as necessary for the functioning of anysociety. Further, even if such a political and monetary transformation
were possible, Bitcoin’s diminishing supply growth rate is likely to
continue to make it an attractive speculative bet for many, which wouldin itself cause it to grow further and acquire a larger monetary role. Inmy assessment, a global monetary return to gold might be the mostsignificant threat to Bitcoin, yet it is both unlikely to happen and
unlikely to destroy Bitcoin completely.
Another possibility for derailing Bitcoin would be through the
invention of a new form of sound money that is superior to Bitcoin.Many seem to think that the other cryptocurrencies that mimic Bitcoincould achieve this, but it is my firm belief that none of the coins
that copy Bitcoin’s design can compete with Bitcoin on being sound
money,forreasonsdiscussedatlengthinthenextsectionofthechapter,primarily: Bitcoin is the only truly decentralized digital currency whichhas grown spontaneously as a finely balanced equilibrium betweenminers, coders, and users, none of whom can control it.

ever possible to develop one currency based on this design, because
once it became obvious that it is workable, any attempt at copying itwill have been a top-down and centrally controlled network which will
never escape the control of its creators.
So when it comes to Bitcoin’s structure and technology, it is highly
unlikelythatanycointhatcopiesitcouldreplaceBitcoin.Anewdesignand technology for implementing digital cash and hard money mightproduce such a competitor, although it is not possible to predict theemergence of such a technology before it is created, and a familiaritywiththeproblemofdigitalcashovertheyearswillmakeitclearthatthis
is not an invention that would be easy to devise.
Altcoins
While Bitcoin was the first example of a peer-to-peer electronic cash,
it was certainly not the last. Once Nakamoto’s design was out in the
open, and the currency succeeded in gaining value and adopters, many
copied it to produce similar currencies. Namecoin was the first suchcurrency,whichusedBitcoin’scodeandstartedoperationinApril2011.Atleast732digitalcurrencieswerecreatedbyFebruary2017,accordingto coinmarketcap.com.
While it is common to think that these currencies exist in compe-

future, in reality they are not in competition with Bitcoin because they

late programmer Hal Finney, who passed away in August 2014. After a
few days of transacting with Finney and experimenting with the soft-
ware, more members began to join the network to transact and mine.
Nakamoto disappeared in mid-2010, citing “moving to new projects”and has most likely never been heard from since.
9In all likelihood,
there are around 1 million bitcoins that are held in an account that is
or was controlled by Nakamoto, but these coins have not moved once.
Nakamoto did, however, take extreme caution to ensure that he will
not be identified, and until this day there is no compelling evidence toidentify who the real Nakamoto is. Had he wanted to be identified, he
would already have come forward. Had he left any evidence that could
lead to the tracing of his identity, it would have likely already been usedto do so. All of his writings and communications have been pored over
obsessively by investigators and journalists to no avail. It is high time for
everyone involved in Bitcoin to stop concerning themselves with thequestionoftheidentityofNakamoto,andacceptthatitdoesnotmatter
to the operation of the technology, in the same way that the identity of
the inventor of the wheel no longer matters.

Bitcoin has continued to grow and thrive in all the metrics men-
tioned in Chapter 8, while the authority of any individual or party
over it has diminished to insignificance. Bitcoin can be understood asa sovereign piece of code, because there is no authority outside of itthat can control its behavior. Only Bitcoin’s rules control Bitcoin, andthepossibilityofchangingtheserulesinanysubstantivewayhasbecome

It is the sovereignty of Bitcoin code, backed by proof-of-work,
which makes it a genuinely effective solution to the double-spendingproblem, and a successful digital cash. And it is this trustlessness which
other digital currencies cannot replicate. Facing any digital currency
builtafterBitcoinisadeepexistentialcrisis:becauseBitcoinisalreadyinexistence, with more security, processing power and an established userbase, anybody looking to use digital cash will naturally prefer it over
smaller and less secure alternatives. Because the replication of the code
to generate a new coin is almost costless, and the imitation coins pro-liferate, no single coin is likely to develop any sort of significant growthor momentum unless there is an active team dedicated to nurturing it,growing it, coding it, and securing it. Being the first such invention,
Bitcoin demonstrating its value as digital cash and hard money was
enough to secure growing demand for it, allowing it to succeed whenthe only person behind it was an anonymous programmer who practi-cally spent no money on promoting it. Being fundamentally knock-offsthat are very easy to recreate, all altcoins do not have this luxury of

words, after the Bitcoin genie got out of the bottle, anybody trying to
build an alternative to Bitcoin will only succeed by investing heavily inthecoin,makingthemeffectivelyincontrolofit.Andaslongasthereis
a party with sovereign power over a digital currency, then that currency
cannot be understood as a form of digital cash, but rather, a form ofintermediated payment—and a very inefficient one at that.
This presents a dilemma facing designers of alternative currencies:
without active management by a team of developers and marketers, no
digital currency will attract any attention or capital in a sea of 1,000 +
currencies. But with active management, development, and marketingby a team, the currency cannot credibly demonstrate that it is not con-trolled by these individuals. With a group of developers in control ofthe majority of coins, processing power, and coding expertise, the cur-
rencyispracticallyacentralizedcurrencywheretheinterestsoftheteam
dictate its development path. There is nothing wrong with a centralizeddigital currency, and we may well get such competitors in a free mar-ket without government restrictions. But there is something deeply and
fundamentally wrong about a centralized currency that adopts a highly
cumbersomeandinefficientdesignwhoseonlyadvantageistheremovalof a single point of failure.
This problem is more pronounced for digital currencies that begin
with an Initial Coin Offering, which creates a highly visible group of
developers communicating publicly with investors, making the entire
project effectively a centralized project. The trials and tribulations ofEthereum, the largest coin in terms of market value after Bitcoin, illus-trate this point vividly.
The Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) was the first
implementation of smart contracts on the Ethereum network. After
more than $150 million was invested in this smart contract, an attackerwas able to execute the code in a way that diverted around one-thirdof all the DAO’s assets to his own account. It would be arguablyinaccurate to describe this attack as a theft, because all the depositors
had accepted that their money will be controlled by the code and
nothing else, and the attacker had done nothing but execute the codeas it was accepted by the depositors. In the aftermath of the DAO hack,Ethereum developers created a new version of Ethereum where thisinconvenient mistake never occurred, confiscating the attacker’s fundsTrim Size: 6in x 9in Ammous c10.tex V1 - 03/05/2018 1:09pm Page 255 k

and distributing them to his victims. This re-injection of subjective
human management is at odds with the objective of making code intolaw, and questions the entire rationale of smart contracts.
If the second largest network in terms of processing power can have
its blockchain record altered when the transactions do not go in a waythatsuitstheinterestsofthedevelopmentteam,thenthenotionthatanyof the altcoins is truly regulated by processing power is not tenable. Theconcentrationofcurrencyholding,processingpower,andprogramming

There is nothing about Bitcoin’s design that suggests it would be

Bitcoin’s operation—putting transactions into blocks which are chainedtogether to form the ledger—can somehow be deployed to solve orimprove economic or social problems, or even “revolutionize” them,as is the wont of every newfangled overhyped toy invented these days.“Bitcoin is not important, but the underlying blockchain technology
is what holds promise” is a mantra that has been repeated ad nauseam
between 2014 and 2017 by banking executives, journalists, and politi-cians, who all share one thing in common: a lack of understanding ofhow Bitcoin actually works. (See Figure 22.)
The fixation with blockchain technology is a great example of

A comparison will help give a sense of just how inefficient bitcoin
is as a method for running transactions. If we strip away the trappings of
decentralization, proof-of-work verification, mining, and trustlessness,and run a centralized version of Bitcoin, it would essentially consist ofan algorithm for generating coins, and a database for coin ownershipthat processes around 300,000 transactions per day. Such tasks are triv-ial, and any modern personal computer could perform them reliably.In fact, a regular off-the-shelf consumer laptop can be made to processaround 14,000 transactions per second, or all of Bitcoin’s current dailytransaction volume in 20 seconds.
12To process Bitcoin’s entire yearly
transaction volume, a personal laptop would need little more than twohours.
The problem with running such a currency on a personal laptop,
however, is that it requires trust in the owner of the laptop and in the

software system run without requiring trust in any single party to notdefraud the record of transactions or alter the rate of currency issuance,
theonlydesignanyonehasfoundisBitcoin’sdecentralizedpeer-to-peer
network with proof-of-work verification. This is not a trivial softwareproblem, and it took decades of computer programmers attemptingdifferent designs before one was found that could demonstrablyachieve this. Whereas a good consumer laptop today has a hashrate
around 10 megahashes per second, the Bitcoin network collectively

transactions that require so much processing power; making the entire
system trustless does. For any other computing process to be run usingblockchain technology, it would need to fulfill two criteria:

Thisiswhynodescanberunonpersonalcomputers,whereasindividualminers have the processing power of hundreds of personal computers.
Should the operation of the ledger itself become too complex, nodes
will need to be large servers instead of personal computers, destroyingthe possibility of decentralization.
The Bitcoin blockchain has placed a 1-megabyte limit on the size
of each block, which has limited the pace at which the blockchain
has grown. That limit allows simple computers to be able to main-
tain and run a node. Should the size of each block increase, or shouldthe blockchain be used for more sophisticated processes such as thosetoutedbyblockchainenthusiasts,itwouldbecometoolargetoberunonindividual computers. Centralizing the network over a few large nodes

it from appreciating too quickly and thus displacing fiat currencies. For
the first time since the abolition of the gold standard, Bitcoin has madesound money easily available to anyone in the world who wants it. Thishighly unlikely combination of lightweight computing load and heavyeconomic significance is why it has made sense to grow the size of the
Bitcoin network’s processing power to the largest network in history.

The first implication of this analysis is that any change to Bitcoin’s
protocol that increases the size of the blockchain is highly unlikely topass, not just for the reasons of immutability mentioned before, but also
because it would likely prevent most node operators from managing to
run their own nodes, and because they are the ones who decide whichsoftware runs, it is safe to assume a significant intransigent minority ofnode operators will continue to run the current software, holding theircurrent bitcoins, making any attempt to upgrade the Bitcoin software

that removing all human discretion would be a massive advantage.
An analogy with the automobile is instructive here. In 1885, when
Karl Benz added an internal combustion engine to a carriage to pro-duce the first autonomously powered vehicle, the express purpose of
that move was to remove horses from carriages and free people from
having to constantly deal with horse excrement. Benz was not trying tomake horses faster. Burdening a horse with a heavy metal engine willnot make it go faster; it will only slow it down while doing nothingto reduce the amount of excrement it produces. Similarly, as Chapter 8
explained, the colossal processing power needed to make the Bitcoin
network operate eliminates the need for a trusted third party to processpayments or determine the supply of money. If the third party remains,then all of that processing power is a pointless waste of electricity.
Only time will tell whether this model for Bitcoin will continue to
grow in popularity and adoption. It is possible that Bitcoin will grow
to displace many financial intermediaries. It is also possible that bitcoinwill stagnate or evenfail and disappear. What cannot happen is Bitcoin’sblockchain benefiting the intermediation it was specifically designed toreplace.
For any trusted third party carrying out payments, trading, or
recordkeeping, the blockchain is an extremely costly and inefficienttechnology to utilize.

after its invention, blockchain technology has not yet managed to break
through in a successful, ready-for-market commercial application otherthan the one for which it was specifically designed: Bitcoin.
Instead, an abundance of hype, conferences, and high-profile dis-
cussions in media,government, academia,industry, and the World Eco-nomic Forum on the potential of blockchain technology has emerged.
Many millions of dollars have been invested in venture capital, research,
and marketing by governments and institutions that are seduced by thehype, without any practical result.
Blockchain consultants have built prototypes for stock trading, asset
registry, voting, and payment clearance. But none of them have beencommercially deployed because they are more expensive than simplermethods relying on established database and software stacks, as the gov-ernment of Vermont recently concluded.

Meanwhile, banks don’t have a great track record in applying earlier
technological advances for their own use. While JPMorgan Chase’s
CEO Jamie Dimon was touting blockchain technology in Davosin January 2016, his bank’s Open Financial Exchange interfaces—atechnology from 1997 to provide aggregators a central database ofcustomer information—had been down for two months.
In contrast, the Bitcoin network was born from the blockchain
design two months after Nakamoto presented the technology. To thisday, it has been operating uninterrupted and growing to more than$150 billion worth of bitcoins. The blockchain was the solution to
the electronic cash problem. Because it worked, it grew quickly while
Nakamoto worked anonymously and only communicated curtly viaemail for about two years. It did not need investment, venture capital,conferences, or advertisement.
As will become apparent from this exposition, the notion that a
“blockchain technology” exists and can be deployed to solve any spe-cific problems is highly dubious. It is far more accurate to understandthe blockchain structure as an integral part of the operation of Bitcoinand its testnets and copycats. Nevertheless, the term blockchain tech-nology is used for simplicity in elucidation. The next section of this

Potential Applications of Blockchain Technology
Anoverviewofstartupsandresearchprojectsrelatedtoblockchaintech-nology concludes that the potential applications of blockchains can bedivided into three main fields:

Bitcoin has a blockchain not because it allows for faster and cheaper
transactions, but because it removes the need to trust in third-partyintermediation:transactionsareclearedbecausenodescompetetoverifythem, yet no node needs to be trusted.

What can be clearly seen is that blockchain payment applications willhave to be with the blockchain’s own decentralized currency, and notwith centrally controlled currencies.
Contracts
Currently, contracts are drafted by lawyers, judged by courts, andenforced by the police. Smart contract cryptographic systems suchas Ethereum encode contracts into a blockchain to make themTrim Size: 6in x 9in Ammous c10.tex V1 - 03/05/2018 1:09pm Page 266 k

k266 THE BITCOIN STANDARD
self-executing, with no possibility for appeal or reversal and beyond the
reach of courts and police. “Code is law” is a motto used by smart con-
tract programmers. The problem with this concept is that the language
lawyers use to draft contracts is understood by far more people than the
code language used by smart contract drafters. There are probably only
a few hundred people worldwide with the technical expertise to fully
understand the implications of a smart contract, and even they could
miss glaring software bugs. Even as more people become proficient in
the programming languages necessary to operate these contracts, the
few people who are most proficient at it will by definition continue to
have an advantage over the rest. Code competence will always offer a
strategic advantage to the most proficient over everyone else.
This all became apparent with the first implementation of smart
contracts on the Ethereum network, the Decentralized Autonomous
Organization (DAO). After more than $150 million was invested in
this smart contract, an attacker was able to execute the code in a way
that diverted around a third of all the DAO’s assets to his own account.
Itwouldbearguablyinaccuratetodescribethisattackasatheft,because
all the depositors had accepted that their money would be controlled by
the code and nothing else, and the attacker had done nothing but exe-

where this inconvenient mistake never occurred. This re-injection of
subjective human management is at odds with the objective of making
code into law, and questions the entire rationale of smart contracts.
Ethereum is the second largest blockchain after Bitcoin in terms of
its processing power, and while the Bitcoin blockchain cannot effec-
tively be rolled back, that Ethereum can be rolled back means that all
blockchains smaller than Bitcoin’s are effectively centralized databases
under the control of their operators. It turns out code is not really law,
because the operators of these contracts can override what the con-
tract executes. Smart contracts have not replaced courts with code, but
they have replaced courts with software developers with little experi-
ence, knowledge, or accountability in arbitrating. It remains to be seen
whether courts and lawyers will remain uninvolved as the ramifications
of such forks continue to be explored.Trim Size: 6in x 9in Ammous c10.tex V1 - 03/05/2018 1:09pm Page 267 k

The DAO was the first and so far only sophisticated application of
a smart contract on a blockchain, and the experience suggests wider
implementation is still a long way off, if it ever were to occur. All other
applications currently only exist in prototype. Perhaps in a hypotheticalfuture where code literacy is far more common and code more pre-dictable and reliable, such contracts might become more commonplace.

while still leaving them subject to editing, forking, and overruling bythe blockchain’s engineers, then the entire exercise serves no purposebut the generation of buzzwords and publicity. A far more likely future
for smart contracts is that they will exist over secured centralized com-
putersoperatedbytrustedthirdpartieswiththeabilitytooverridethem.Thisformalizestherealityofblockchainsmartcontractsaseditablewhilereducingtheprocessingpowerrequirementandreducingtheattackvec-
tors possible to compromise this.
For actual operational blockchains, demand will likely only be
found for simple contracts whose code can be easily verified andunderstood. The only rationale for employing such contracts on a
blockchain rather than a centralized computer system would be for the
contracts to utilize the blockchain’s native currency in some form, asall other contracts are better enforced and supervised without the extra
burden of a blockchain distributed system. The only existing meaning-
ful blockchain contract applications are for simple time-programmedpayments and multi-signature wallets, all of which are performed withthe currency of the blockchain itself, mostly on the Bitcoin network.
Database and Record Management
Blockchain is a reliableand tamper-proof database and asset register, butonlyfortheblockchain’snativecurrencyandonlyifthecurrencyisvalu-
able enough for the network to have strong enough processing power
to resist attack. For any other asset, physical or digital, the blockchainis only as reliable as those responsible for establishing the link betweentheassetandwhatreferstoitontheblockchain.Therearenoefficiency

is no proof-of-work. Trust in third-party intermediaries must remain
while the processing power and time required for running the databaseincreases. A blockchain secured with a token could be used as a notaryservice, where contracts or documents are hashed onto a block of trans-actions, allowing any party to access the contract and be sure that the
version displayed is the one that was hashed at the time. Such a service
will provide a market for scarce block space, but is unworkable with anyblockchain without a currency.
The Economic Drawbacks of Blockchain Technology
From examining the previous three potential applications of blockchaintechnology, five main obstacles to wider adoption are identified.
1. Redundancy
Having every transaction recorded with every member of the networkisaverycostlyredundancywhoseonlypurposeistoremoveintermedi-ation. For any intermediary, whether financial or legal, there is no senseinaddingthisredundancywhileremaininganintermediary.Thereisnogoodreasonforabanktowanttosharearecordofallitstransactionswithall banks, nor is there a reason for a bank to want to expend significant
resources on electricity and processing power to record the transactions
of other financial institutions with one another. This redundancy offersincreased costs for no conceivable benefit.
2. Scaling

bersofadistributednetworkwillbefarlargerthanacentralizednetwork

model toward having payments cleared on second layers, such as theLightning Network, or off the blockchain with intermediaries.

result in fewer nodes. The network will tend toward centralization as a
result.Themostcost-effectivewaytohavealargevolumeoftransactions
is centralization in one node.
3. Regulatory Compliance
Blockchainswiththeirowncurrency,suchasBitcoin,existorthogonallyto the law; there is virtually nothing that any government authority cando to affect or alter their operation. The Federal Reserve chair has evensaid as much: it has no authority to regulate Bitcoin at all.
14Roughly
every ten minutes on the Bitcoin network, a new block is released con-
taining all the valid transactions made in these ten minutes, and nothingelse. Transactions will clear if valid, and will not clear if not valid, and
there is nothing that regulators can do to overturn the consensus of the
network processing power. Applying blockchain technology in heavilyregulated industries such as law or finance, with currencies other than
Bitcoin,willresultinregulatoryproblemsandlegalcomplications.Reg-
ulations were designed for an infrastructure much different from that ofblockchainandtherulescannotbeeasilytailoredtofitblockchainoper-
ation, with the radical openness of having all records distributed to all
network members. Further, a blockchain operates online across juris-dictions with different regulatory rules, so compliance with all rules is
difficult to ensure.
4. Irreversibility
With payments, contracts, or databases operated by intermediaries,
human or software errors can be easily reversed by appealing to the
intermediary. In a blockchain, things are infinitely more complicated.

any mistaken transaction. Blockchain technology, after all, is meant toreplicate cash transactions online, which includes the irreversibility of
cash transactions and none of the benefits of custodial intermediation
in redress and revision. Human and software errors constantly occur inbanking, and employing a blockchain structure will only result in theseerrors being far more costly to fix. The DAO incident revealed justhowexpensiveandprotractedsuchareversalwouldbeonablockchain,
requiringweeksofcodingandpublicrelationscampaignstogetnetwork
members to agree to adopt the new software. And even after all that,the old chain continued to exist and took away a significant a mount
of the value and hashing power of the old network. This loss createda situation where two records of the previous transactions exist, one in
which the DAO attack succeeded, and another in which it did not.
If the second largest network in terms of processing power can have
its blockchain record altered when the transactions do not go in a waythat suits the interests of the development team, then the notion that
any other blockchain is truly regulated by processing power is not ten-
able. The concentration of currency holding, processing power, andprogrammingskillsinthehandsofonegroupofpeoplewhoaredefactocolleagues in a private venture defeats the purpose of implementing thiselaborate structure.
Such a reversal is extremely impractical and unlikely in Bitcoin,
for the reasons discussed in Chapter 9, mainly that every party in theBitcoin network is only capable of joining the network by agreeingto existing consensus rules. The adversarial interests of different mem-bers of the ecosystem have always meant that the network only grew
throughattractingthevoluntarycontributionsofpeoplewhoarewilling
toaccepttheconsensusrules.InBitcoin,theconsensusrulesareconstantand the users can choose to come and go. For every other blockchainproject which was established by imitating Bitcoin’s design, there wasalways a single group responsible for setting the rules of the system, and

Current bestpracticeinthesefieldscontainsreversibilityandsupervisionbylegalandregulatory authorities, but employs cheaper, faster, and more efficientmethods.
5. Security
The security of a blockchain database is entirely reliant on theexpenditure of processing power on verification of transactions andproof-of-work. Blockchain technology can best be understood as theconversion of electric power to verifiable undisputed records of own-
ership and transactions. For this system to be secure, the verifiers who
expend the processing power have to be compensated in the currencyof the payment system itself, to align their incentive with the health andlongevity of the network. Should payment for the processing power bemade in any other currency, then the blockchain is essentially a privaterecord maintained by whoever pays for the processing power. Thesecurity of the system rests on the security of the central party fundingthe miners, but it is compromised by operating on a shared ledger,which opens up many possibilities for security breaches to take place.An open decentralized system built on verification by processing poweris more secure the more open the system and the larger the numberof network members expending processing power on verification.Acentralizedsystemreliantonasinglepointoffailureislesssecurewitha larger number of network members able to write to the blockchain aseach added network member is a potential security threat.
Blockchain Technology as a Mechanism for Producing Electronic
Cash
The only commercially successful application of blockchain technology
so far is electronic cash, and in particular, Bitcoin. The most commonpotential applications touted for blockchain technology—payments,contracts, and asset registry—are only workable to the extent that they
run using the decentralized currency of the blockchain. All blockchainsTrim Size: 6in x 9in Ammous c10.tex V1 - 03/05/2018 1:09pm Page 272 k

without currencies have not moved from the prototype stage to
commercial implementation because they cannot compete with current
best practice in their markets. Bitcoin’s design has been freely available
online for nine years, and developers can copy and improve on it tointroduce commercial products, but no such products have appeared.
